Desalinating brackish water has become a sustainable technology for drinking and agriculture to overcome global water scarcity. Thriving biodesalination technology has become more attractive and eco‐friendly than the present physicochemical desalination methods, which are expensive and energy‐intensive. Researchers are exploring the bioutilization of nature's potential for desalination using halophiles like haloarchaea, halobacteria, halophytic algae, and plants. Biomimetic desalination membranes have been developed, inspired by the desalination mechanism in animals. This comprehensive review explores recent advancements and potential applications of halophiles in biodesalination to exploit them effectively. It provides an overview of the opportunities and challenges associated with harnessing halophiles for the removal of salts from brackish and seawater sources. This review also focuses on insights into biomolecules produced by the halophilic microorganisms and halophytes in the desalination process. Understanding the mechanism of action of these biomolecules will edify the effective unexplored research areas in biomimicry and bioutilization to overcome the existing limitations in water treatment.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Salt cress (Thellungiella halophila) is a small winter annual crucifer with a short life cycle. It has a small genome (about 2 × Arabidopsis) with high sequence identity (average 92%) with Arabidopsis, and can be genetically transformed by the simple floral dip procedure. It is capable of copious seed production. Salt cress is an extremophile native to harsh environments and can reproduce after exposure to extreme salinity (500 mm NaCl) or cold to −15°C. It is a typical halophyte that accumulates NaCl at controlled rates and also dramatic levels of Pro (&amp;gt;150 mm) during exposure to high salinity. Stomata of salt cress are distributed on the leaf surface at higher density, but are less open than the stomata of Arabidopsis and respond to salt stress by closing more tightly. Leaves of salt cress are more succulent-like, have a second layer of palisade mesophyll cells, and are frequently shed during extreme salt stress. Roots of salt cress develop both an extra endodermis and cortex cell layer compared to Arabidopsis. Salt cress, although salt and cold tolerant, is not exceptionally tolerant of soil desiccation. We have isolated several ethyl methanesulfonate mutants of salt cress that have reduced salinity tolerance, which provide evidence that salt tolerance in this halophyte can be significantly affected by individual genetic loci. Analysis of salt cress expressed sequence tags provides evidence for the presence of paralogs, missing in the Arabidopsis genome, and for genes with abiotic stress-relevant functions. Hybridizations of salt cress RNA targets to an Arabidopsis whole-genome oligonucleotide array indicate that commonly stress-associated transcripts are expressed at a noticeably higher level in unstressed salt cress plants and are induced rapidly under stress. Efficient transformation of salt cress allows for simple gene exchange between Arabidopsis and salt cress. In addition, the generation of T-DNA-tagged mutant collections of salt cress, already in progress, will open the door to a new era of forward and reverse genetic studies of extremophile plant biology.</jats:p>",

These halophiles were molecularly identified and characterized with or without NaCl conditions. Characterization was based on tests such as indole acetic acid (IAA), exopolysaccharides (EPS), and siderophores (SID) production; solubilization of phosphate (P), potassium (K), zinc (Zn), and manganese (Mn); mineralization of phytate; enzymatic activity (acid and alkaline phosphatase, phytases, xylanases, and chitinases) and the mineralization/solubilization mechanisms involved (organic acids and sugars). Moreover, compatibility among bacteria was assessed. Eleven halophiles were characterized as highly tolerant to NaCl (2.5 M). The bacteria isolated were all different from each other. Two belonged to Bacillus velezensis and one to B. pumilus while the rest of bacteria were identified up to the genus level as belonging to Bacillus, Halobacillus, Halomonas, Pseudomonas, Nesterenkonia, and three strains of Oceanobacillus. The biochemical responses of nutrient solubilization and enzymatic activity were different between bacteria and were influenced by the presence of NaCl. Organic acids were involved in P mineralization and nutrient solubilization. Tartaric acid was common in the solubilization of P, Zn, and K. Maleic and vanillic acid were only detected in Zn and K solubilization, respectively. Furthermore, sugars appeared to be involved in the solubilization of nutrients; fructose was detected in the solubilization tests. Therefore, these biochemical bacterial characteristics should be corroborated in vivo and tested as a consortium to mitigate saline stress in glycophytes under a global climate change scheme that threatens to exacerbate soil salinity.</jats:p>",

The contribution of this interaction has piqued the interest of experts, who plan to do more research using beneficial microorganism in order to accomplish this vision. Plants engage in a wide range of interrelationship with soil microorganism, spanning the entire spectrum of ecological potential which can be mutualistic, commensal, neutral, exploitative, or competitive. Mutualistic microorganism found in plant-associated microbial communities assist their host in a number of ways. Many studies have demonstrated that the soil microbiome may provide significant advantages to the host plant. However, various soil conditions (pH, temperature, oxygen, physics-chemistry and moisture), soil environments (drought, submergence, metal toxicity and salinity), plant types/genotype, and agricultural practices may result in distinct microbial composition and characteristics, as well as its mechanism to promote plant development and defence against all these stressors.

Plants face extreme environmental conditions that may affect their biological mechanisms, thereby influencing their growth and development. Microorganisms possess substantial metabolites that aid in helping plants mitigate abiotic stresses. Plants’ interaction with microbes constitutes a diversified ecosystem, as sometimes both the partners share a mutualistic relationship. Endophytes, plant-growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPRs), and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMFs) are examples of microorganisms that play an essential role in alleviating abiotic stresses and, hence, improving plant growth. The plant–microbe interaction leads to the modulation of complex mechanisms in the plant cellular system. Moreover, the residing microbial flora also inhibits the phytopathogens, therefore, it becomes part of plants’ innate defense system. Keeping in view the growing environmental concerns, it is important to identify the role of the plant microbiome in the transportation of nutrients to maintain sustainable production. Furthermore, it is important to identify the factors enabling plants to recruit beneficial microbial species and how to deal with the potential pathogens. Therefore, this review aims to summarize the impacts of various abiotic stressors on agricultural productivity and the role of beneficial microorganisms in mitigating the negative effects of abiotic stresses. The literature review also shows that the beneficial microbes, including PGPRs, AMFs, and endophytes, adopt various mechanisms for ameliorating the negative effects of various stresses. It has been observed that biochar and microbes, either individually or in combination, can play a significant role in maintaining plant growth under stress conditions. Although conventional inoculation of beneficial microbes mitigates abiotic stresses and enhances productivity, the advancement in genetic engineering would help transfer specific genes from the microbes to plants to aid in abiotic stress mitigation.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Soil salinity, a growing issue worldwide, is a detrimental consequence of the ever-changing climate, which has highlighted and worsened the conditions associated with damaged soil quality, reduced agricultural production, and decreasing land areas, thus resulting in an unsteady national economy. In this review, halo-tolerant plant growth-promoting rhizo-microbiomes (PGPRs) are evaluated in the salinity-affected agriculture as they serve as excellent agents in controlling various biotic–abiotic stresses and help in the augmentation of crop productivity. Integrated efforts of these effective microbes lighten the load of agro-chemicals on the environment while managing nutrient availability. PGPR-assisted modern agriculture practices have emerged as a green strategy to benefit sustainable farming without compromising the crop yield under salinity as well as salinity-affected supplementary stresses including increased temperature, drought, salinity, and potential invasive plant pathogenicity. PGPRs as bio-inoculants impart induced systemic tolerance (IST) to plants by the production of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), antioxidants, osmolytes, extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), phytohormones, and ACC-deaminase and recuperation of nutritional status and ionic homeostasis. Regulation of PGPR-induced signaling pathways such as MAPK and CDPK assists in salinity stress alleviation. The “Next Gen Agriculture” consists of the application of designer crop microbiomes through gene editing tools, for instance, CRISPR, and engineering of the metabolic pathways of the microbes so as to gain maximum plant resistance. The utilization of omics technologies over the traditional approaches can fulfill the criteria required to increase crop yields in a sustainable manner for feeding the burgeoning population and augment plant adaptability under climate change conditions, ultimately leading to improved vitality. Furthermore, constraints such as the crop specificity issue of PGPR, lack of acceptance by farmers, and legal regulatory aspects have been acknowledged while also discussing the future trends for product commercialization with the view of the changing climate.</jats:p>",

In this work, seeds of the cash crop halophyte Salicornia ramosissima were inoculated with five different plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria consortia, isolated from the rhizosphere of five halophytes in southwestern Spain salt marshes. For the first time, we recorded seed germination response to three interactive abiotic stressors, CO2 (400 and 700 ppm), temperature (25 and 29 ℃) and salinity (171, 510 and 1030 mM NaCl), all of them related to climate change. Salinity played a decisive role, as no significant differences were registered between treatments at 171 mM NaCl and no germination took place at 1030 mM NaCl. At 510 mM NaCl, one rhizobacterial consortium improved seed parameters notably, increasing up to 114% germination percentage and 65% seedlings biomass.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The hydroponic farming significantly enhances the yield and enables multiple cropping per year. These advantages can be improved by using plant growth-promoting fungi (PGPF) either under normal or stress conditions. In this study, the fungal strain (A3) isolated from the rhizosphere of the halophyte plant <jats:italic>Aeluropus littoralis</jats:italic> was identified as <jats:italic>Penicillium olsonii</jats:italic> based on sequence homology of its ITS region. The A3 fungus was shown to be halotolerant (up to 1 M NaCl) and its optimal growth was at 27°C, but inhibited at 40°C. In liquid culture medium, the A3 produced indole acetic acid (IAA) especially in the presence of L-tryptophan. Tobacco plants grown under hydroponic farming system were used to evaluate the promoting activity of the direct effect of A3 mycelium (DE) and the indirect effect (IDE) of its cell-free culture filtrate (A3CFF). The results showed that for the two conditions (DE or IDE) the tobacco seedlings exhibited significant increase in their height, leaf area, dry weight, and total chlorophyll content. Interestingly, the A3CFF (added to the MS liquid medium or to nutrient solution (NS), prepared from commercial fertilizers) induced significantly the growth parameters, the proline concentration, the catalase (CAT) and the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities of tobacco plants. The A3CFF maintained its activity even after extended storage at 4°C for 1 year. Since the A3 is a halotolerant fungus, we tested its ability to alleviate salt stress effects. Indeed, when added at 1:50 dilution factor to NS in the presence of 250 mM NaCl, the A3CFF enhanced the plant salt tolerance by increasing the levels of total chlorophyll, proline, CAT, and SOD activities. In addition, the treated plants accumulated less Na<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> in their roots but more K<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> in their leaves. The A3CFF was also found to induce the expression of five salt stress related genes (NtSOS1, NtNHX1, NtHKT1, NtSOD, and NtCAT1). Finally, we proved that the A3CFF can reduce by half the chemical fertilizers inputs. Indeed, the tobacco plants grown in a hydroponic system using 0.5xNS supplemented with A3CFF (1:50) exhibited significantly higher growth than those grown in 0.5xNS or 1xNS. In an attempt to explain this mechanism, the expression profile of some growth related genes (nitrogen metabolism (NR1, NRT1), auxin (TRYP1, YUCCA6-like), and brassinosteroid (DET2, DWF4) biosynthesis) was performed. The results showed that all these genes were up-regulated following plant treatment with A3CFF. In summary the results revealed that the halotolerant fungus <jats:italic>P. olsonii</jats:italic> can stimulates tobacco plant growth, enhances its salt tolerance, and reduces by half the required chemical fertilizer inputs in a hydroponic farming system.</jats:p>",

Along with these, others are also frequent although their presence is not restricted to gypsum; they show a clear preference for them (gypsocline). While this phenomenon (gypsophily) has been studied regionally, and various hypotheses put forward to explain it, there has been little global synthesis. We present a preliminary check-list on the gypsophile and gypsocline flora of the Palaearctic and Australian areas as a part of a project to develop a global checklist of the World’s gypsophytes, which can broaden our ecological and biogeographical understanding of these unique environments. The database contains 935 taxa spanning 54 countries. The Irano-Turanian region —and to a lesser extent the Mediterranean region— emerged as the richest territories in terms of gypsophile species; this richness was much reduced in the Saharo-Arabian and, especially in the Eurosiberian regions. The factors that can modulate the richness of gypsophytes in a region are discussed and have been distributed into four groups: a) geological and edaphic factors; b) factors linked to the insular nature of outcrops; c) climatic variables and their interaction with the soil; d) biogeographical factors. The importance of those factors linked to insularity and, especially, to water availability is emphasized. Because the soil structure of many gypsum outcrops reduces water ability to plants, such outcrops can be regarded as “dry-islands” surrounded by less xeric substrates. The fact that gypsophytes can be grouped within a few major flowering plant clades across continents, confirms their pre-adaptations to these harsh and unique environments. Our work provides a preliminary database for exploring ecological and biogeographic issues relating to gypsophily, and we hope it will stimulate global interest in these valuable ecosystems.</jats:p>",

Salt-tolerant plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) can alleviate the adverse impacts of salt stress by mediating molecular, biochemical, and physiological status. In the present study, the bacterium Bacillus mycoides PM35 showed resistance up to 3 M NaCl stress and exhibited plant growth-promoting features. Under salinity stress, the halo-tolerant bacterium B. mycoides PM35 showed significant plant growth-promoting traits, such as the production of indole acetic acid, siderophore, ACC deaminase, and exopolysaccharides. Inoculation of B. mycoides PM35 alleviated salt stress in plants and enhanced shoot and root length under salinity stress (0, 300, 600, and 900 mM). The B. mycoides PM35 alleviated salinity stress by enhancing the photosynthetic pigments, carotenoids, radical scavenging capacity, soluble sugars, and protein content in inoculated maize plants compared to non-inoculated plants. In addition, B. mycoides PM35 significantly boosted antioxidant activities, relative water content, flavonoid, phenolic content, and osmolytes while reducing electrolyte leakage, H2O2, and MDA in maize compared to control plants. Genes conferring abiotic stress tolerance (CzcD, sfp, and srfAA genes) were amplified in B. mycoides PM35. Moreover, all reactions are accompanied by the upregulation of stress-related genes (APX and SOD).

    "abstract": "<jats:p>\n            Human activities have globally increased and altered the ion concentration of freshwater ecosystems. The proliferation of potash mines in Germany (especially intense in the early 1900s) constitutes a good example of it. The effluents and runoff coming from potash mines led to extreme salt concentrations (e.g. 72 g l\n            <jats:sup>–1</jats:sup>\n            of total salt content, approx. 149 mS cm\n            <jats:sup>–1</jats:sup>\n            ) in surrounding rivers and streams, causing ecosystem degradation (e.g. massive algal blooms and fish kills). This promoted scientific research that was mostly published in German, thereby being neglected by the wide scientific community. Here, the findings of the German literature on freshwater salinization are discussed in the light of current knowledge. German studies revealed that at similar ion concentrations potassium (K\n            <jats:sup>+</jats:sup>\n            ) can be the most toxic ion to freshwater organisms, whereas calcium (Ca\n            <jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>\n            ) could have a toxicity ameliorating effect. Also, they showed that salinization could lead to biodiversity loss, major shifts in the composition of aquatic communities (e.g. dominance of salt-tolerant algae, proliferation of invasive species) and alter organic matter processing. The biological degradation caused by freshwater salinization related to potash mining has important management implications, e.g. it could prevent many European rivers and streams from reaching the good ecological status demanded by the Water Framework Directive. Within this context, German publications show several examples of salinity thresholds and biological indices that could be useful to monitor and regulate salinization (i.e. developing legally enforced salinity and ion-specific standards). They also provide potential management techniques (i.e. brine collection and disposal) and some estimates of the economic costs of freshwater salinization. Overall, the German literature on freshwater salinization provides internationally relevant information that has rarely been cited by the English literature. We suggest that the global editorial and scientific community should take action to make important findings published in non-English literature more widely available.\n          </jats:p>\n          <jats:p>This article is part of the theme issue ‘Salt in freshwaters: causes, ecological consequences and future prospects’.</jats:p>",

Traditional methods of managing stress factors, such as developing resistant varieties, chemical fertilizers, and pesticides, have shown limited success in the presence of combined biotic and abiotic stress factors. Halotolerant bacteria found in saline environments have potential as plant promoters under stressful conditions. These microorganisms produce bioactive molecules and plant growth regulators, making them a promising agent for enhancing soil fertility, improving plant resistance to adversities, and increasing crop production. This review highlights the capability of plant-growth-promoting halobacteria (PGPH) to stimulate plant growth in non-saline conditions, strengthen plant tolerance and resistance to biotic and abiotic stressors, and sustain soil fertility. The major attempted points are: (i) the various abiotic and biotic challenges that limit agriculture sustainability and food safety, (ii) the mechanisms employed by PGPH to promote plant tolerance and resistance to both biotic and abiotic stressors, (iii) the important role played by PGPH in the recovery and remediation of agricultural affected soils, and (iv) the concerns and limitations of using PGHB as an innovative approach to boost crop production and food security.</jats:p>",

The addition of adsorptive polymeric resins in fungal fermentations has been seen to promote the production of new secondary metabolites and is a tool used consistently to generate new compounds with potential biological activities. A total of 349 fungal strains isolated from 63 selected plant species from arid ecosystems located in the southeast of the Iberian Peninsula, were characterized morphologically as well as based on their ITS/28S ribosomal gene sequences. The fungal community isolated was distributed among 19 orders including Basidiomycetes and Ascomycetes, being <jats:italic>Pleosporales</jats:italic> the most abundant order. In total, 107 different genera were identified being <jats:italic>Neocamarosporium</jats:italic> the genus most frequently isolated from these plants, followed by <jats:italic>Preussia</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Alternaria</jats:italic>. Strains were grown in four different media in presence and absence of selected resins to promote chemical diversity generation of new secondary metabolites. Fermentation extracts were evaluated, looking for new antifungal activities against plant and human fungal pathogens, as well as, cytotoxic activities against the human liver cancer cell line HepG2. From the 349 isolates tested, 126 (36%) exhibited significant bioactivities including 58 strains with exclusive antifungal properties and 33 strains with exclusive activity against the HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cell line. After LCMS analysis, 68 known bioactive secondary metabolites could be identified as produced by 96 strains, and 12 likely unknown compounds were found in a subset of 14 fungal endophytes. The chemical profiles of the differential expression of induced activities were compared. As proof of concept, ten active secondary metabolites only produced in the presence of resins were purified and identified. The structures of three of these compounds were new and herein are elucidated.</jats:p>",

In this study, we aimed to investigate the potential of deep-sea Dermacoccus abyssi MT1.1T to mitigate salt stress in tomato seedlings and identified genes related to plant growth promotion and salt stress mitigation. D. abyssi MT1.1T exhibited plant growth promoting traits namely indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and siderophore production and phosphate solubilization under 0, 150, 300, and 450 mM NaCl in vitro. Inoculation of D. abyssi MT1.1T improved tomato seedlings growth in terms of shoot length and dry weight compared with non-inoculated seedlings under 150 mM NaCl. In addition, increased total soluble sugar and total chlorophyll content and decreased hydrogen peroxide content were observed in tomato inoculated with D. abyssi MT1.1T. These results suggested that this strain mitigated salt stress in tomatoes via osmoregulation by accumulation of soluble sugars and H2O2 scavenging activity. Genome analysis data supported plant growth promoting and salt stress mitigation potential of D. abyssi MT1.1T. Survival and colonization of D. abyssi MT1.1T were observed in roots of inoculated tomato seedlings. Biosafety testing on D. abyssi MT1.1T and in silico analysis of its whole genome sequence revealed no evidence of its pathogenicity.

Therefore, a systemic approach to climate adaptation will be needed which acknowledges the multidimensional nature of plant-microbe-environment interactions. In the last two scores of years, there has been an enhancement in the understanding of plant’s response to microbes at physiological, biochemical, and molecular levels due to the availability of techniques and tools. This review highlights some of the critical factors influencing plant-microbe interactions under stress. The association and response of microbe and plants as a result of several stresses such as temperature, salinity, metal toxicity, and greenhouse gases are also depicted. New tools to study the molecular complexity of these interactions, such as genomic and sequencing approaches, which provide researchers greater accuracy, reproducibility, and flexibility for exploring plant-microbe–environment interactions under a changing climate, are also discussed in the review, which will be helpful in the development of resistant crops/plants in present and future.</jats:p>",

Recent trends in the field of PGPB research led to the development of versatile multifaceted PGPB that can be used in different field conditions such as biocontrol of plant pathogens in metal contaminated soils. Unfortunately, all these research efforts lead to the development of PGPB that failed to perform in salty environments. Therefore, it is urgently needed to address this drawback of these PGPB toward their efficient performance in salinity context. In this paper we provide a review of state-of-the-art research in the field of PGPB and propose a road map for the development of next generation versatile and multifaceted PGPB that can perform in salinity. Beyond soil desalinization, our study paves the way towards the development of PGPB able to provide services in diverse salty environments such as heavy metal contaminated, or pathogen threatened. Smart development of salinity adapted next generation biofertilizers will inevitably allow for mitigation and alleviation of biotic and abiotic threats to plant productivity in salty environments.</jats:p>",

During systematic sampling the frequency of the species along roads was significantly higher in the Mediterranean (native area), than along Hungarian (non-native area) roads, however the average number of individuals at the sampling localities were very similar, and no significant difference could be detected. Using a germination experiment, we demonstrate that although the species is able to germinate even at high salt concentrations, salt is not required for germination. Indeed salt significantly decreases germination probability of the seeds.

Two species, a diploid Salicornia patula and a tetraploid S. emerici were recognized. They can be easily distinguished by floral characters, but not only by their habitus, which varies extremely according to environmental factors. Both species differ also in seed morphology. Salicornia patula has dimorphic seeds, with larger central seeds reaching high germination rates. Germination patterns helped to explain the habitat preferences. The species rarely co-occur, however. The rare S. patula occupies drier habitats, on coastal mudflats or sands that are irregularly inundated. It occurs within the assoc. Suaedo maritimae-Salicornietum patulae. Salicornia emerici occupies the lowest coastal mudflats, regularly inundated, where nutrient-rich conditions prevail, and forms an almost monotypical assoc. Salicornietum emerici. Due to the synonymy of S. veneta with S. emerici, we exclude the occurrence of S. veneta in Croatia as an independent taxon.</jats:p>",

Brassica species contains oilseed and vegetable crops with great economic importance. Advances in understanding the mechanisms of salt stress in Brassica plants have enabled the development of approaches to better induce plant defense mechanisms at the time of their occurrence through the use of beneficial microorganisms or molecules. Both endophytic and rhizospheric microbes contribute to the mitigation of abiotic stresses in Brassica plants by promoting the growth of their host under stress conditions. In this review we summarized so far reported microorganisms with beneficial effects on Brassica plants and their mode of action. Another approach in mitigating the harmful effect of soil salinity may involve the application of different molecules that are involved in the stress response of Brassica plants. We reviewed and summarized their potential mode of action, methods of application and pointed out further research directions.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Environmental limitations influence food production and distribution, adding up to global problems like world hunger. Conditions caused by climate change require global efforts to be improved, but others like soil degradation demand local management. For many years, saline soils were not a problem; indeed, natural salinity shaped different biomes around the world. However, overall saline soils present adverse conditions for plant growth, which then translate into limitations for agriculture. Shortage on the surface of productive land, either due to depletion of arable land or to soil degradation, represents a threat to the growing worldwide population. Hence, the need to use degraded land leads scientists to think of recovery alternatives. In the case of salt-affected soils (naturally occurring or human-made), which are traditionally washed or amended with calcium salts, bio-reclamation via microbiome presents itself as an innovative and environmentally friendly option. Due to their low pathogenicity, endurance to adverse environmental conditions, and production of a wide variety of secondary metabolic compounds, members of the genus Streptomyces are good candidates for bio-reclamation of salt-affected soils. Thus, plant growth promotion and soil bioremediation strategies combine to overcome biotic and abiotic stressors, providing green management options for agriculture in the near future.</jats:p>",

Here, we demonstrate that this resilience occurs even after rapid osmotic shocks caused by a threefold change in salinity (a reduction from 34 to 12% salts) leading to massive amounts of archaeal cell lysis. Specifically, our temporal metagenomic datasets identified two co-occurring ecotypes within the most dominant archaeal population of the brines Haloquadratum walsbyi that exhibited different salt concentration preferences. The dominant ecotype was generally more abundant and occurred in high-salt conditions (34%); the low abundance ecotype always co-occurred but was enriched at salinities around 20% or lower and carried unique gene content related to solute transport and gene regulation. Despite their apparent distinct ecological preferences, the ecotypes did not outcompete each other presumably due to weak functional differentiation between them. Further, the osmotic shock selected for a temporal increase in taxonomic and functional diversity at both the Hqr. walsbyi population and whole-community levels supporting the specialization-disturbance hypothesis, that is, the expectation that disturbance favors generalists. Altogether, our results provide new insights into how intraspecies diversity is maintained in light of substantial gene-content differences and major environmental perturbations.</jats:p>",

In the present study, two calcium sensor families, CBL and CIPK, were investigated in a halophyte plant, Aeluropus littoralis, with a comprehensive analysis. Here, six AlCBL genes, and twenty AlCIPK genes were studied. The analysis of the gene structure and conserved motifs, as well as physicochemical properties, showed that these genes are highly conserved during evolution. The expression levels of AlCBL genes and AlCIPK genes were evaluated under salt stress in leaf and root tissue. Based on the real-time RT-PCR results, the AlCIPK gene family had a higher variation in mRNA abundance than the AlCBL gene family. AlCIPK genes were found to have a higher abundance in leaves than in roots.

Using genomic data, we found evidence of fine-scale population structure and gene flow among the localities established across the high-elevation plateau as well as fingerprints of historical demographic expansion. We showed that an increase in the effective population size could coincide with the Last Glacial Period, which was followed by the species demographic decline during the Holocene. Geographic distance plays a vital role in shaping the spatial genetic structure of P. pamirica alongside with isolation-by-environment and habitat fragmentation. Our results highlight a complex history of divergence and gene flow in this species-poor alpine region during the Late Quaternary.

The unsupervised classification of images was performed using GRASS GIS algorithms through several modules: ‘i.cluster’ was used to generate image classes; ‘i.maxlik’ was used for classification using the maximal likelihood discriminant analysis, and auxiliary modules, such as ‘i.group’, ‘r.support’, ‘r.import’, etc., were used. This document includes technical descriptions of the scripts used for image processing with detailed comments on the functionalities of the GRASS GIS modules. The results include the identified variations in the ephemeral salt lakes within the Algerian part of the Sahara over a 9-year period (2014–2022), using a time series of Landsat OLI/TIRS multispectral images that were classified using GRASS GIS. The main strengths of the GRASS GIS framework are the high speed, accuracy, and effectiveness of the programming codes for image processing in environmental monitoring. The presented GitHub repository, which contains scripts used for the satellite image analysis, serves as a reference for the interpretation of remote sensing data for the environmental monitoring of arid and semi-arid areas of Africa.</jats:p>",

Three different eco-friendly extraction methods are tested: microwave-assisted extraction (MAE), pressurized fluid extraction (PFE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE). Various specific parameters are optimized for each of them. Global extraction yields are calculated for all extracts. Moreover, the extracts are analyzed by HPLC–DAD–ELSD, and the obtained profiles are compared to estimate qualitatively and semi-quantitatively their composition. The practicality of each technique is also discussed. The results show that the various parameters tested for PFE and MAE do not drastically affect the extraction of our interest compounds.

We aimed to reveal bacterial effects on the formation of apoplastic barriers and hormone concentration in relation to maintaining ion homeostasis and growth of salt-stressed plants. The rhizosphere of a durum wheat variety was inoculated with cytokinin-producing Bacillus subtilis and auxin-producing Pseudomonas mandelii strains. Plant growth, deposition of lignin and suberin and concentrations of sodium, potassium, phosphorus and hormones were studied in the plants exposed to salinity. Accumulation of sodium inhibited plant growth accompanied by a decline in potassium in roots and phosphorus in shoots of the salt-stressed plants. Inoculation with both bacterial strains resulted in faster appearance of Casparian bands in root endodermis and an increased growth of salt-stressed plants. B. subtilis prevented the decline in both potassium and phosphorus concentrations and increased concentration of cytokinins in salt-stressed plants. P. mandelii decreased the level of sodium accumulation and increased the concentration of auxin. Growth promotion was greater in plants inoculated with B. subtilis. Increased ion homeostasis may be related to the capacity of bacteria to accelerate the formation of Casparian bands preventing uncontrolled diffusion of solutes through the apoplast. We discuss the relative impacts of the decline in Na accumulation and maintenance of K and P content for growth improvement of salt-stressed plants and their possible relation to the changes in hormone concentration in plants.</jats:p>",

Crossing them opens the possibility for organisms to colonize new niches and diversify, but requires profound physiological adaptations and is supposed to happen rarely in evolutionary history. We tested the relative importance of each ecological barrier by building the phylogeny, based on mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase gene (COI) sequences, of a group of microorganisms common in freshwater and soils, the Arcellidae (Arcellinida; Amoebozoa). We explored the biodiversity of this family in the sediments of athalassohaline water bodies (i.e. of fluctuating salinity that have non-marine origins). We found three new aquatic species, which represent, to the best of our knowledge, the first reports of Arcellinida in these salt-impacted ecosystems, plus a fourth terrestrial one in bryophytes. Culturing experiments performed on Arcella euryhalina sp. nov. showed similar growth curves in pure freshwater and under 20 g/L salinity, and long-term survival at 50 g/L, displaying a halotolerant biology. Phylogenetic analyses showed that all three new athalassohaline species represent independent transition events through the salinity barrier by freshwater ancestor, in contrast to the terrestrial species, which are monophyletic and represent a unique ecological transition from freshwater to soil environments.</jats:p>",

PHBV is a biodegradable polymer showing physiochemical properties of biotechnological and biomedical interest and can be used as an alternative to plastics made from chemical synthesis (which are not environmentally friendly). The versatile metabolism of H. mediterranei makes the use of waste as a carbon source for cellular growth and PHA synthesis possible. In this work, cellular growth and the production and characterization of PHBV using two different types of confectionery waste were analyzed and compared with cellular growth and PHBV synthesis in a standard culture media with glucose of analytical grade as a carbon source. The PHBV granules produced were analyzed by TEM and the biopolymer was isolated and characterized by GC-MS, FTIR NMR, and DSC. The results reveal that H. mediterranei can use these two residues (R1 and R2) for pure PHBV production, achieving 0.256 and 0.983 g PHBV/L, respectively, which are among the highest yields so far described using for the first-time waste from the candy industry. Thus, a circular economy-based process has been designed to optimize the upscaling of PHBV production by using haloarchaea as cell factories and valorizing confectionery waste.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Almost one third of Earth’s land surface is arid, with deserts alone covering more than 46 million square kilometres. Nearly 2.1 billion people inhabit deserts or drylands and these regions are also home to a great diversity of plant and animal species including many that are unique to them. Aridity is a multifaceted environmental stress combining a lack of water with limited food availability and typically extremes of temperature, impacting animal species across the planet from polar cold valleys, to Andean deserts and the Sahara. These harsh environments are also home to diverse microbial communities, demonstrating the ability of bacteria, fungi and archaea to settle and live in some of the toughest locations known. We now understand that these microbial ecosystems i.e. microbiotas, the sum total of microbial life across and within an environment, interact across both the environment, and the macroscopic organisms residing in these arid environments. Although multiple studies have explored these microbial communities in different arid environments, few studies have examined the microbiota of animals which are themselves arid-adapted. Here we aim to review the interactions between arid environments and the microbial communities which inhabit them, covering hot and cold deserts, the challenges these environments pose and some issues arising from limitations in the field. We also consider the work carried out on arid-adapted animal microbiotas, to investigate if any shared patterns or trends exist, whether between organisms or between the animals and the wider arid environment microbial communities. We determine if there are any patterns across studies potentially demonstrating a general impact of aridity on animal-associated microbiomes or benefits from aridity-adapted microbiomes for animals. In the context of increasing desertification and climate change it is important to understand the connections between the three pillars of microbiome, host genome and environment.</jats:p>",

Calcium signaling, as a vital mechanism, enables plants to respond to external stimuli, including abiotic and biotic stresses, and coordinate the basic processes of the growth and development. In the present study, the calcium sensor families, including CBL and CIPK, were investigated in the halophyte plant, Aeluropus littoralis, with a comprehensive analysis. Here, six AlCBL genes, and twenty AlCIPK genes were presented. The analysis of the gene structure and conserved motifs, as well as physicochemical properties, showed that these genes are highly conserved during evolution. The expression levels of AlCBL genes and AlCIPK genes were evaluated under salt stress in leaf and root tissue. Based on the real-time RT-PCR results, AlCIPK gene family had a higher variation in mRNA abundance compared to the AlCBL gene family. The AlCIPKs were found to have a higher abundance in leaves than in roots. The results suggest that the interaction pattern of AlCBL genes with AlCIPK is tissue-specific, and different interactions can be expected in leaves and roots. Based on these patterns AlCIPK3.1 - AlCBL4.1 and AlCIPK1.2 - AlCBL4.4 can interact in root tissue, while the AlCBL10 has the potential to interact with the AlCIPK5, AlCIPK26 and AlCIPK12.3 in the leaf tissue. These findings provide valuable information on the structure and function of calcium sensor families in Aeluropus littoralis a halophyte plant, for future research on the biological function of CBLs and CIPKs on salt stress resistance.</jats:p>"

Consequently, we aimed to (1) estimate the carbon stocks of the vegetation, litter, and soil of three natural Habitats of Community Interest of a Mediterranean non-tidal salt marsh–a halophilous scrub, a salt meadow, and a glasswort sward–and (2) determine how differences in floristic composition and community structure among habitats over 1 year are related to the amount and distribution of carbon stored in plants and soils. Results show that the halophilous scrub and the salt meadow were constituted by mature plant communities with overall stable carbon stocks in the vegetation, litter, and soil (0–20 cm), which were approximately 4 and 2.5 times larger, respectively, than those found in the glasswort sward (1013 ± 40 g C m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup>).

The differences in community compositions were associated with differences in the total and reducing sugar contents and viscosity of the seeds, thus possibly connected to differences in the osmotic pressure tolerance of the endophytes.

Compared to S. emerici, both halophytes recorded the highest percentages of organic matter and crude protein and higher concentrations of Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+ and Fe2+. These three halophytes, harvested during the summer period, showed important digestibility percentages (&gt; 70 % MS), exceeding those of alfalfa, and low levels of ADF, ADL and anti-nutritive compounds (condensed tannins, flavonoids and saponins). These findings suggest that the valorization of these native halophytes as fodder is promising, in particular S. alpini and S. fruticosa.

To investigate the underlying molecular mechanism involved in the salinity response in rice, we initially screened 238 rice cultivars after salt treatment at the seedling stage and identified two highly salt-tolerant cultivars determined by the relative damage rate parameter. The majority of cultivars (94.1%) were ranked as salt-sensitive and highly salt-sensitive. Transcriptome profiling was completed in highly salt-tolerant, moderately salt-tolerant, and salt-sensitive under water and salinity treatments at the seedling stage. Principal component analysis displayed a clear distinction among the three cultivars under control and salinity stress conditions. Several starch and sucrose metabolism-related genes were induced after salt treatment in all genotypes at the seedling stage. The results from the present study enable the identification of the ascorbate glutathione pathway, potentially participating in the process of plant response to salinity in the early growth stage. Our findings also highlight the significance of high-affinity K+ uptake transporters (HAKs) and high-affinity K+ transporters (HKTs) during salt stress responses in rice seedlings.

Biodiversitas 23: 3338-3343. Nitrogen is a very important nutrient in plant growth because it is one of the constituents of plant cells. The availability of nitrogen nutrients in the soil is very low, and this is because nitrogen is easily leached and easy to evaporate. Application of N-fixing microbes is one way to increase the availability of nitrogen in the soil. This study aims to utilize nitrogen-fixing microbes to increase nutrient uptake, production, and efficiency of urea fertilization. The study used a factorial randomized block design (RBD) consisting of Factor I, namely biofertilizer consisting of 4 treatments, namely without the application of bacteria (N0), Dyella japonica 5g (N1), Enterobacter cloacae 5g (N2) and D. japonica 2.5g + E. cloacae 2.5g (N3). Factor II is urea fertilizer with 5 levels U0 = No urea fertilizer, U1 = 1.25 g, U2 = 2.50 g, U3 = 3.75g and U4 = 5g. Parameters observed were plant height observed in weeks I-VIII, plant nitrogen (N) uptake (mg/plant), phosphorus (P) uptake (mg/plant), potassium (K) uptake (mg/plant), and plant production (g). Sampling of plants for analysis of nutrient uptake was carried out at the end of the vegetative period, namely the 8th week, while for plant production parameters, plant samples were taken at the 12th week. The results showed that the applications of nitrogen-fixing bacteria could increase N uptake up to 89.35%, P uptake up to 79.57%, K uptake up to 48.81%, and crop production increase up to 49.76%. The applications of nitrogen-fixing microbes can streamline the use of urea fertilizer by up to 50%. In general, the best treatment is the applications of D. japonica and E. cloacae plus 2.5g urea (N3U2).</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Dittrichia graveolens (L.) W. Greuter, an invasive plant species of Mediterranean origin, is recorded for the first time in Romania. We found the species in October 2020 in two separate locations along the main highway that connects Brașov and Sibiu cities, in Southern Transylvania, central Romania. We present here the first data concerning the species occurrence in the investigated area, its observed habitat, local distribution and accompanying species. We presume that the main vector for the introduction and dispersal of this species in Romania is the high traffic density along the major roads. Dittrichia graveolens has proven its invasive potential in other regions of Europe and North America of similar temperature and precipitation regimes under an overall temperate climate. Consequently, taking into account its fast dispersal, especially in the more favourable habitats for its establishment that exist along the major roads from the lower altitudes and the riparian communities from the western, southern and eastern parts of Romania, we conclude that close monitoring of the species occurrence should be undertaken in order to better assess its full invasive potential in our country and to reduce the risk of impact on natural plant communities.</jats:p>",

Determining how soil microbial communities respond to these stress factors and identifying individual phylotypes with potential to tolerate these conditions while promoting plant growth could help prevent negative impacts on crop productivity. This study used amplicon sequencing and several bioinformatic programs to characterize differences in the composition and potential functional capabilities of soil bacterial, fungal, and archaeal communities in five agricultural fields that varied in salinity and HM concentrations within the Indus basin region of Pakistan. The composition of bacteria with the potential to fix atmospheric nitrogen (N) and produce the enzyme 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (<jats:italic>ACC</jats:italic>) deaminase were also determined. Microbial communities were dominated by: <jats:italic>Euryarchaeota</jats:italic> (archaea)<jats:italic>, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Planctomycetota</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Firimicutes, Patescibacteria</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Acidobacteria</jats:italic> (bacteria), and <jats:italic>Ascomycota</jats:italic> (fungi), and all soils contained phylotypes capable of N-fixation and ACC-deaminase production. Salinity influenced bacterial, but not archaeal or fungal communities. Both salinity and HM altered the relative abundance of many phylotypes that could potentially promote or harm plant growth. These stress factors also appeared to influence the potential functional capabilities of the microbial communities, especially in their capacity to cycle phosphorous, produce siderophores, and act as symbiotrophs or pathotrophs. Results of this study confirm that farms in this region are at risk due to salinization and excessive levels of some toxic heavy metals, which could negatively impact crop and human health. Changes in soil microbial communities and their potential functional capabilities are also likely to affect several critical agroecosystem services related to nutrient cycling, pathogen suppression, and plant stress tolerance. Many potentially beneficial phylotypes were identified that appear to be salt and HM tolerant and could possibly be exploited to promote these services within this agroecosystem. Future efforts to isolate these phylotypes and determine whether they can indeed promote plant growth and/or carry out other important soil processes are recommended. At the same time, identifying ways to promote the abundance of these unique phylotypes either through modifying soil and crop management practices, or developing and applying them as inoculants, would be helpful for improving crop productivity in this region.</jats:p>",

This region’s population is projected to reach 2.4 billion by the year 2050, which will increase its food demand by 60%. However, recurrent droughts, temperature extremes, and increasing soil salinity are emerging as threats to present and future food security as they restrict agricultural productivity. The biggest challenge facing the SSA region lies in finding ways to adapt its agricultural practices to climate change. This article explores the potential role of extremophile microorganisms in enhancing crop resilience to abiotic stress. Research has so far shown that extremophiles alleviate drought stress in plants by increasing the expression of an array of novel genes, including genes responsible for induced drought, heat and salt stress tolerance, increased production of enzymatic antioxidants, as well as increased production of plant growth promoting phytohormones. Importantly, research shows that (i) extremophile-induced plant growth promotion and stress alleviation is triggered by the presence the stressor (ii) phylogenetically diverse microorganisms isolated from different desert plants can induce stress tolerance in heterologous crop hosts. These findings raise hopes of proofing crops against climate change-induced drought stress and hence ensure food security. However, research on the role of extremophiles in agriculture in the SSA region still lags behind. There is need to build capacity in extremophile agricultural biotechnology in this region, primarily in the form of bioprospecting for isolates exhibiting strong plant growth promoting capabilities.</jats:p>",

Microorganism-based biostimulants are recognized as sustainable alternatives to traditional agrochemicals to enhance and protect agricultural production. Marine actinobacteria are a well-known source of novel compounds for biotechnological uses. In addition, former studies have suggested that coral symbiont actinobacteria may support co-symbiotic photosynthetic growth and tolerance and increase the probability of corals surviving abiotic stress. We have previously shown that this activity may also hold in terrestrial plants, at least for the actinobacteria<jats:italic>Salinispora arenicola</jats:italic>during induced heterologous symbiosis with a wild Solanaceae plant<jats:italic>Nicotiana attenuata</jats:italic>under<jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic>conditions. Here, we further explore the heterologous symbiotic association, germination, growth promotion, and stress relieving activity of<jats:italic>S. arenicola</jats:italic>in tomato plants under agricultural conditions and dig into the possible associated mechanisms. Tomato plants were grown under normal and saline conditions, and germination, bacteria-root system interactions, plant growth, photosynthetic performance, and the expression of salt stress response genes were analyzed. We found an endophytic interaction between<jats:italic>S. arenicola</jats:italic>and tomato plants, which promotes germination and shoot and root growth under saline or non-saline conditions. Accordingly, photosynthetic and respective photoprotective performance was enhanced in line with the induced increase in photosynthetic pigments.

In addition, using seagrass as a feedstock for bioethanol production can provide a sustainable and renewable energy source while addressing environmental concerns. It is a resource-rich plant that offers several advantages for bioethanol production, including its high cellulose content, rapid growth rates, and abundance in coastal regions. To reduce sugar content and support efficient microbial fermentation, co-fermentation of macroalgae with seagrass (marine biomass) can provide complementary sugars and nutrients to improve process yields and economics. This review comprehensively covers the current status and future potential of fermenting macroalgal biomass and seagrass, as well as possible combinations for maximizing bioethanol production from non-edible energy crops. An overview is provided on the biochemical composition of macroalgae and seagrass, pretreatment methods, hydrolysis, and fermentation processes. Key technical challenges and strategies to achieve balanced co-substrate fermentation are discussed. The feasibility of consolidated bioprocessing to directly convert mixed feedstocks to ethanol is also evaluated.

As a result of metabolic functions based on 16S rDNA amplicon data, the genes related to potassium accumulation played an important role in osmoregulation in Tuz Lake, where the archaea population was dominant. Furthermore, bacteriorhodopsin, halorhodopsin, and sensory rhodopsin functions were determined. The abundance of bacteriorhodopsin and halorhodopsin were increased in summer and spring, respectively.</jats:p>",

The main objective is to identify soil properties associated with the presence of different Limonium species. Methods – We conducted a systematic phytocoenological and edaphic survey over 37 locations across the Balearic archipelago. Canonical Correspondence Analysis was applied to the physicochemical characteristics of soils in which 29 species of Limonium grow. Results – The distribution of Limonium species has a high correlation to specific edaphic factors. The species can be clustered into four major groups. The first group represents species with a high edaphic selectivity – soils characterized by having a high proportion of sand, SO42- and Ca2+. The second group is composed of species with high levels of SAR, OM and SO42- /Cl- ratio. The third group includes species present in soils with a loamy texture, low Ca2+ /Mg2+ ratio and high levels of CO32- and Mg2+. The fourth group includes plants which colonize soils that have a sandy texture, low salinity and high proportion of CO32-. Conclusions – A strong correlation between the distribution of Limonium species and soil characteristics exist. The study contributes to the establishment of foundations for habitat conservation, cultivation and recovery projects for endangered species of Limonium.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>&lt;p&gt;Foliar betalainic plants are commonly found in dry and exposed environments such as deserts and sandbanks. This marginal habitat has led many researchers to hypothesise that foliar betalains provide tolerance to abiotic stressors such as strong light, drought, salinity and low temperatures. Among these abiotic stressors, soil salinity is a major problem for agriculture affecting approximately 20% of the irrigated lands worldwide. Betacyanins may provide functional significance to plants under salt stress although this has not been unequivocally demonstrated. The purpose of this thesis is to add knowledge of the various roles of foliar betacyanins in plants under salt stress. For that, a series of experiments were performed on Disphyma australe, which is a betacyanic halophyte with two distinct colour morphs in vegetative shoots.  In chapter two, I aimed to find the effect of salinity stress on betacyanin pigmentation in D. australe and it was hypothesised that betacyanic morphs are physiologically more tolerant to salinity stress than acyanic morphs. Within a coastal population of red and green morphs of D. australe, betacyanin pigmentation in red morphs was a direct result of high salt and high light exposure. Betacyanic morphs were physiologically more tolerant to salt stress as they showed greater maximum CO₂ assimilation rates, water use efficiencies, photochemical quantum yields and photochemical quenching than acyanic morphs. Contrary to this, the green morphs, although possessing the ability to synthesise betalains in flower petals, did not produce betalains in vegetative shoots in response to salt stress. Moreover, green morphs, in terms of leaf photosynthesis, performed poorly under salinity stress.  In chapter three I further investigated the physiological benefit of betacyanin accumulation in D. australe. I postulated that betacyanin in the leaves of D. australe can protect the salt stressed chloroplasts from harmful excessive light by absorbing significant amount of radiation. To test this, a novel experimental approach was used; the key biosynthetic step for betacyanin synthesis was identified, which was deficient in vegetative shoots of the green morphs. By supplying the product of this enzymatic reaction, L-DOPA, betacyanin synthesis could be induced in the leaves of green morphs. This model system was used to compare the photoprotective responses of red vs. green leaves. The L-DOPA induced betacyanic leaves showed similar responses (such as smaller reductions and faster recoveries of PSII and less H₂O₂ production than in the green leaves) to naturally betacyanic leaves when exposed to high light and salinity. The differences in photoinhibition between red and green leaves were attributed to the light absorbing properties of betacyanins. L-DOPA treated and naturally red leaves showed lower photoinactivation than green leaves when exposed to white or green light, although not when exposed to monochromatic (red) light.  In chapter four, I used a similar experimental model to that in the third chapter and showed that other than photoprotection, betacyanins in leaves may be involved in salt tolerance by enhancing toxic ion (such as Na⁺) sequestration in betacyanic epidermal cells, storing Na⁺ away from sensitive mesophyll tissue. The Na⁺ localization between red and green leaves was compared after salinity treatment by using a sodium binding stain (SBFI-AM) and Cryo-SEM analysis. L-DOPA treated and natural red leaves sequestered Na⁺ ions to the epidermal cell layer. In contrast, green leaves retained Na⁺ in the mesophyll tissue, which suggested that red leaves were better equipped to tolerate salt-specific effects. Therefore, betacyanic plants were more tolerant to applied salinity stress and showed relatively higher growth rates than green morphs.  The findings of this thesis provide a significant contribution to our understanding of the role of betacyanins in plants under salinity stress. My data suggest that the multi-faceted properties of betacyanins (such as their photoprotective function, and their involvement in sequestration of toxic ions) clearly provide a benefit to plants under salinity stress.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

These changes demand a selection of an alternative method that is not only environment friendly but also sustainable. Aquaponics provides an ideal system for growing plants in soilless conditions. The Aquaponics system is a dual scheme of growing plants and fish at the same time. These systems utilize different approaches for growing plants and fishes simultaneously. This is through by circulating mechanism of an aquaponic system where fish waste in aquaculture provides nutrients to plants for the nourishment of hydroponic units. And plants purify water by utilizing nitrogen to maintain water for fish survival and growth. An aquaponic system is a sustainable methodology that does not affect the environment like conventional farming and is built on the recycling principle. A variety of vegetables like lettuce, cucumber, coriander, spinach, eggplant, basil are popular among domestic aquaponics farmers.

During salinity stress, plants encounter significant changes in their physio and biochemical activities, leading to decreased growth and yield. Bacillus species are used as biofertilizers and biopesticides for pearl millet and other crops to promote growth and yield. The use of Bacillus in saline soils has been beneficial to combat the negative effect of salinity on plant growth and yield. In this context, the present study emphasizes the use of two Bacillus species, i.e. Bacillus megaterium JR-12 and B. pumilus GN-5, which helped in alleviating the impact of salinity stress on the growth activities in salt-stressed pearl millet. Pearl millet seeds were treated with two strains, B. megaterium JR-12 and B.pumilus GN-5, individually and in combination under 50, 100 and 150 mM of sodium chloride stress. The treated plants showed higher plant height, biomass accumulation, and photosynthetic apparatus than the non-treated plants. Additionally, the treated plants showed increased osmoprotectant levels under salinity stress compared to control plants. The antioxidant enzyme content was improved post-inoculation, indicating the efficient stress-alleviating potential of both strains of Bacillus species. Moreover, inoculation of these microbes significantly increased plant growth attributes in plants treated with a combination of Bp-GN-5 + Bm-JR-12 and the reduction rates of plant growth were found to be alleviated to 9.12%, 20.30% and 33%, respectively.

Current seawater desalination methods can effectively provide freshwater and meet the growing demand for this resource. However, they are becoming increasingly controversial owing to their adverse environmental impacts, including high energy consumption and generation of desalination brine. For millions of years, various species of organisms such as plants, microalgae, and bacteria have adapted to environments with variable salinity and have developed mechanisms to eliminate excess intracellular NaCl. This has encouraged scientists to study the possibility of using biological processes for seawater desalination. Biodesalination is an emerging technology for the selective removal of Na + and Cl − from salt water by various halophile organisms, such as macrophytes, microalgae, and cyanobacteria, with very low energy consumption. Microbial desalination cells that allow simultaneous desalination of water in conjunction with wastewater treatment are also included in this category. The direct use of living organisms such as halophile plants, microalgae, and bacteria to desalinate water appears to be a promising field. However, the development and practical applicability of these technologies depend on the living organisms selected for desalinating seawater.</jats:p>",

High levels of radioactive exposure from external irradiation and a high radionuclide content lead to a decrease in the alpha diversity of soil bacterial communities, both in laboratory settings and environmental conditions. The effects of low or moderate exposure are not consistently pronounced or unidirectional. Functional differences among taxonomic groups that dominate in contaminated soil indicate a variety of adaptation strategies. Bacteria identified as multiple-stress tolerant; exhibiting tolerance to metals and antibiotics; producing antioxidant enzymes, low-molecular antioxidants, and radioprotectors; participating in redox reactions; and possessing thermophilic characteristics play a significant role. Changes in the taxonomic and functional structure, resulting from increased soil radionuclide content, are influenced by the combined effects of ionizing radiation, the chemical toxicity of radionuclides and co-contaminants, as well as the physical and chemical properties of the soil and the initial bacterial community composition. Currently, the quantification of the differential contributions of these factors based on the existing published studies presents a challenge.</jats:p>",

Analyzing the microbial structure of soil is important for efficient use of the soil, whether it be for agricultural purposes or other uses. Sabkhat Al-Madinah in Saudi Arabia has soil with high salinity and plants that thrive in that environment. The microbial makeup of the soil in this area has not been extensively researched. This study aimed to analyze the microbial structure of two locations in Sabkhat Al-Madinah's soil and examine the correlation with soil properties. The 16S rRNA gene's V3-V4 region was targeted for metagenomic analysis using Illumina MiSeq. The soil chemical properties including EC, pH as well the concentration of some soil elements were determined. The microbial composition of both sites were investigated at different taxonomic levels using MG-RAST and QIIME2 pipelines. There was a significant difference in salt concentration between the two sites that were derived from the same sabkha. The second sample had higher sodium content, leading to increased E.C measures. Moreover, The two samples had different microbial compositions. The first sample was dominated by Bacteroidetes (18.37%), Firmicutes (13.57%) and Proteobacteria (13.57%), while the second one contained Proteobacteria (25.01%), Actinobacteria (12.03%) and Firmicutes (11.36%).

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Salinity is one of the major factors responsible for the deterioration of soils, making them unsuitable for agriculture. The application of halotolerant and halophilic plant growth promoting bacteria (PGPR: Plant Growth Promoting Rhizobacteria) with biological control activities as an inoculant of cultivated plants offers a biological alternative to the use of agrochemicals, particularly when subjected to salt stress. In this perspective, 70 bacterial strains were isolated from saline soils (sebkha) in arid and semi-arid areas of eastern Algeria. Three isolates were selected based on their ability to produce bioactive molecules allowing them to promote plant growth, such as hydrolytic enzymes, indole acetic acid, HCN, NH3, etc. Two of these isolates belong to the genus Serratia and the third is a halophilic Halomonas bacteria. These bacteria were identified based on the 16S rDNA sequence. Antagonism tests against phytopathogenic fungi were carried out. The identification of the antifungal molecules produced by these bacteria was done by high performance liquid chromatography. These bacteria are capable of inhibiting mycelial development against phytopathogenic fungi with rates reaching 80.67% against Botrytis cinerea, 76.22% against Aspergillus niger and 66.67% against Fusarium culmorum for Serratia sp. The strain Halomonas sp. inhibited mycelial growth by production of volatile substances of Aspergillus niger at 71.29%, Aspergillus flavus at 75.49% and Penicillium glabrum at a rate of 72.22%. The identification by HPLC of the antifungal molecules produced by these three bacteria reveals that they are polyphenols, which makes these strains the first rhizobacteria capable of producing phenolic compounds. Finally, pot tests to determine the effectiveness of these strains in promoting wheat growth under salinity stress (125 mM, 150 mM and 200 mM) were carried out. The results revealed that a consortium of two isolates (Serratia sp. and Halomonas sp.) performed best at 125 mM. But, at higher concentrations it was the halophilic bacteria Halomonas sp which gave the best result. In all cases, there was a significant improvement in the growth of wheat seedlings inoculated with the bacteria, compared to non-inoculated controls.</jats:p>"

Though data on bacteria and algae observed in this lake are available in the literature, data on fungi adapted to the conditions of the lake are lacking. The diversity of haloalkalitolerant fungi was low and represented by ascomycetes of the genera Acremonium, Alternaria, Aspergillus, Chordomyces, Emericellopsis, Fusarium, Gibellulopsis, Myriodontium, Penicillium, and Pseudeurotium. Most of the fungi were characterized by moderate alkaline resistance, and they tolerated NaCl concentrations up to 10% w/v. The analysis of the antimicrobial activity of fungi showed that 87.5% of all strains were active against Bacillus subtilis, and 39.6% were also determined to be effective against Escherichia coli. The majority of the strains were also active against Aspergillus niger and Candida albicans, about 66.7% and 62.5%, respectively.

In the arid areas, aggravation of soil salinity has become the primary problem that threatens the high yield in tomato production. As a second messenger substance, cyclic guanosine monophosphate (c-GMP) plays an indispensable role in plant response to salt stress through regulating cell processes to promote plant growth and development. However, this mechanism has not been fully explored in tomato seedlings. In this experiment, the tomato seeds were cultured in distilled water (CK), 20 μM c-GMP (T1), 50 mM NaCl (T2), 20 μM c-GMP + 50 mM NaCl (T3). The results show that 20 μM c-GMP effectively alleviated the inhibition of 50 mM NaCl on tomato growth and development, inducing the expression of 1580 DEGs. 95 DEGs were up-regulated and 442 DEGs were down-regulated (CK vs T1), whereas in the T2 vs T3 comparison 271 DEGs were up-regulated and 772 DEGs were down-regulated. Based on KEGG analysis, the majority of DEGs were involved in metabolism; exogenous c-GMP induced significant enrichment of pathways associated with carbohydrates, phenylpropanoids and fatty acid metabolism.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Beneficial plant-growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) have been reasonably applied to rescue crucial issue for agriculture by salinity soil. Observed most of PGPB was found in endophyte, rhizosphere and soil. Indole acetic acid (IAA)-producing bacteria could naturally stimulate and facilitate plant growth. The knowledge of IAA production and content of bacteria resident in the marine environment has been typically insufficient and limited to date. In recent years, unwarrantable intrusions of sea water have been enlarged in the Mekong River Delta of Vietnam, threatening productive rice fields, local fruits, and cash crops. Therefore, finding PGPB in the coastal regions in the Mekong River Delta as a creative resource for sustainable agriculture is necessary and is a prompt challenge. In this study, IAA-producing bacteria from coastal regions of Ben Tre and Tra Vinh Provinces were isolated and adequately identified. Out of 202 bacterial isolates, 10 isolates showed the possible ability to produce IAA from L-tryptophan. These 10 isolates were objectively evaluated the capacity to produce IAA under 5% (w/v) NaCl in King B and marine broths. The results revealed that IAA production decreased in 5% NaCl, even though bacterial growth increased. These 10 IAA-producing bacteria were classified at the species level, Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus, M. pelagius, M. daepoensis, and Mameliella phaeodactyli by 16S rRNA gene analysis. The most IAA producer in King’s B broth, the isolate C7, was investigated in more detail. The isolate C7 produced the maximum IAA amount (192.2 ± 1.14 µg/ml) under the presence of 20 g/l yeast extract, 2 g/l of L-tryptophan and 1% NaCl. The isolate C7 was able to grow at 1–17% (w/v) NaCl (optimum, 4%), but not in the absence of NaCl, indicating it is a moderate halophilic bacteria. This study highlighted the considerable ability to produce IAA of marine bacteria, which could be thoughtfully considered to use naturally as biofertilizers to promote plant growth in saline intrusion lands. </jats:p>",

Az Arabidopsis thaliana 8 GPXL izoenzimet tartalmaz, amelyek különböző sejtorganellumokban lokalizáltak és eltérő redox-függő folyamatokban játszanak szerepet. Az AtGPXL5 egy kevéssé ismert plazmamembrán-kapcsolt izoenzim, bár szerepét feltételezték a sóstressz tolerancia kialakításában (Gao és mtsai. 2014). Kísérleteinkben konstitutívan túltermeltettük az AtGPXL5 cDNS-t és a növények fejlődésében és NaCl kezelésre adott válaszában vizsgáltuk az AtGPXL5 szerepét. Vizsgálatainkat AtGPXL5-túltermelő (OX-AtGPXL5) és Atgpxl5 mutáns növények felhasználásával végeztük. Eredményeink alapján az alábbi megállapításokat tettük: 1) A 12 napos Arabidopsis thaliana Atgpxl5 inszerciós mutánsok gyökerében magasabb szuperoxid gyök anion és össz ROS szint található kontroll körülmények között is, mint a vad típusú (Col-0) gyökerekben. A magasabb ROS szint az Atgpxl5 hajtások csökkent életképességét eredményezte. 7 napig tartó 100 mM-os NaCl kezelés tovább emelte a gyökerekben a O2•− mennyiségét, szintje meghaladta a vad típusban kialakultat. Ezek alapján az AtGPXL5 fontos szerepet tölthet be a reaktív oxigénformák homeosztázisában és a sejt életképességének fenntartásában. 2) A hat hetes Atgpxl5 mutáns és OX-AtGPXL5 növények antioxidáns mechanizmusait összehasonlítva jelentős különbségek mutatkoztak. Míg az Atgpxl5 mutánsban több antioxidatív enzim emelkedett aktivitást mutatott, az AtGPXL5-túltermelő növényekben a vad típushoz hasonló aktivitásokat mértünk. Míg az Atgpxl5 növények magasabb glutation peroxidáz (GPOX) aktivitással rendelkeztek, az OX-AtGPXL növényekben a GPOX és TPOX (tioredoxin peroxidáz) aktivitás is a vad típuséval azonos szinten működött. 3) Kontroll körülmények között a GSH tartalom szignifikánsan alacsonyabb volt az Atgpxl5 mutáns gyökerekben, míg az OX-AtGPXL5 hajtásban magasabb. Az alkalmazott sóstressz után az AtGPXL5-túltermelő növények rendelkeztek legmagasabb GSH és legalacsonyabb GSSG szinttel, a GSSG mennyisége az Atgpxl5 mutáns gyökerekben nőtt legnagyobb mértékben. Az OX-AtGPXL5 vonalak számított redukciós potenciál értéke negatívabb volt, mint a Col-0 vad típusé. Az eredmények megerősítették, hogy az AtGPXL5 fehérje szerepet játszik a redox állapot szabályozásában, amelyen keresztül a növekedést és fejlődést is befolyásolhatják. 4) Az AtGPXL5 protein szükséges az Arabidopsis thaliana csíranövények normál növekedéséhez és fejlődéséhez. Hiányában csökkent az elsődleges gyökerek hossza, biomasszája, a rozetta mérete, a hajtások klorofill- és antocián tartalma kontroll körülmények között is. 100 mM NaCl jelenlétében az Atgpxl5 mutáns és a vad típusú növények magjainak csírázása gátlódott, azonban az AtGPXL5 túltermelőké nem. Az OX-AtGPXL5 növények normal fiziológiás körülmények között a vad típushoz hasonló fenotípust mutattak, azonban 100 mM NaCl jelenlétében jobban növekedtek: nagyobb rozetta átmérővel rendelkeztek, a levelek nagyobb konvex területet foglaltak el, magasabb klorofill és antocián tartalommal rendelkeztek, mint a Col-0 és Atgpxl5 mutáns növények. Az Atgpxl5-nél megfigyelt csökkent hajtás- és gyökérnövekedés arra enged következtetni, hogy az AtGPXL5 fehérje szerepet játszik a növények normal növekedésében.</jats:p>"

In particular, Salinicola halophilus S28 showed optimal or suboptimal growth in a very wide range of NaCl concentrations, suggesting a great coping ability with salinity variations. These intriguing outcomes did not fit with the general Salinicola halophilus description as a moderately halophilic species. Therefore, this study profiles the actual physiological status of S28 cells subjected to different NaCl concentrations to provide evidence for the actual coping ability of strain S28 with broad salinity variations. Flow cytometry was selected as the evaluation method to study the physiological status of bacterial cells subjected to different salinity levels, monitoring the strain response at different growth phases over 72 h. Strain S28 showed maximal growth at 8% NaCl; however, it grew very well with no statistically significant differences at all salinity conditions (4–24% NaCl). Flow cytometric results provided clear evidence of its actual and strong ability to face increasing salinity, revealing a good physiological response up to 24% of NaCl. In addition, strain S28 showed very similar cell physiological status at all salinity levels, as also indicated by the flat growth profile revealed in the range of 4–24% NaCl. This is the first study regarding the physiological response during the growth of halophilic bacteria under different conditions of salinity via flow cytometry. This technique represents an effective tool for the investigation of the physiological status of each cell, even if it is somehow underrated and underused by microbiologists for this purpose.</jats:p>",

Therefore, the present study focuses on the screening and characterization of halophilic bacteria from different habitats of Odisha, a coastal state in India. The presence of Mg, HCO<sub>3-</sub>, Cl<sup>-</sup>, Fe, Mn and Cu was found in higher concentration in the collected sediment samples. The isolated bacteria were found to be moderately halophilic nature due to their significant growth in 15%-18% (w/v) NaCl. The result showed the utmost number of viable cells (0.022 to 1.75 cfu mL<sup>-1</sup>) in 15%-18% (w/v) NaCl concentration. The multi-metal resistance study showed two strains AS’S-I and BB’S-III having resistance upto multi-metal concentration of 1200 mg L<sup>-1</sup>. There was visible binding of metals ions unto the cell surface as observed through SEM-EDX. Molecular chracterization identified AS’S-I and BB’S-III strains as <italic>Halomonas</italic> sp.

The presence of sodium concentration of 0.07–0.18 mg L<sup>-1</sup> and amino acids such as Arg, Thr, Gln, Glycine, Cys, Met, His were confirmed in the isolated halophiles as osmo-regulators. The biochemical assay showed the presence of catalase, amylase, and urease as antioxidant and essential for the activity of halophilic enzymes attributing to the thriving of the isolated bacteria under high stress condition. Thus, the findings suggest the existence of halophilic bacteria in the coastal areas of Odisha which can be used for remediation of inorganic pollutants.</p>"

About 20% of irrigated lands are affected by salinity worldwide; In India, there are 6.74 million hectares of salt-affected lands. Salt-tolerant Plant Growth Promoting (PGP) microorganisms can enhance the growth of plants in such salt-stressed areas. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the diversity of beneficial fungal communities, screen for their ability to support plant growth, and evaluate the production of various essential compounds in view of plant growth in salt-stressed lands. A total of 68 fungal colonies were isolated from 5 different agroforestry plantation sites in Karur, Tamil Nadu, South India at quarterly intervals. The isolates were screened for sodium chloride (NaCl) tolerance (0%, 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% concentration). A total of 7 isolates showed considerable salt tolerance and were tested qualitatively in-vitro, for PGP traits such as phosphate, potassium, and zinc solubilization, nitrogen fixation, hydrogen cyanide production, siderophore production, and ACC deaminase production. Finally, 5 isolates with maximum values for PGP properties under 20% NaCl concentration were tested for the quantity of Indole-3-Acetic Acid (IAA) and Exo-polysaccharide (EPS) production. All 5 isolates were identified up to the species level using 18S rRNA gene sequencing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on isolating saline-tolerant PGP Fungi (PGPF) from the rhizosphere region of Casuarina equisetifolia and Eucalyptus camaldulensis in Karur, Tamil Nadu, India. In the future, the bioformulation of PGPF and its application will boost the cultivation of tree saplings in this salt affected regions.</jats:p>",

Salinization is a burning issue around the world that affect the plant growth as well as crop production. Due to soil salinization, a fifth of the world's agricultural land has been spoiled. From the geographical setting, Bangladesh is one of the most vulnerable countries to the impact of various natural hazards and disasters. Sundarbans also experienced such natural hazards and disasters, e.g., tsunamis, floods, and cyclones every year for being its location. Moreover, the study area's salinization level is increasing daily. As a result, the plants in the study area are facing a critical situation due to the rapidly changing saline levels. The study attempted to analyze rhizosphere bacteria isolated from wild-type varieties of Sundarbans to endure salt tolerance. This study was conducted using primary and secondary data. Wild-type variety and soil samples were collected from the Sundarbans. To isolate salt-tolerant bacteria, different concentrations of salt were used. The salt tolerance isolates were used to observe the role of seed germination and plant growth. The isolated salt-tolerant bacteria showed their effects on plant growth and seed germination in saline soil. Bacillus and Acinetobacter bacterial species were identified using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, which promoted plant growth and seed germination at a high salt level. Since rhizosphere bacteria play an essential role in enduring salt tolerance, it can be a straightforward and eco-friendly strategy to reduce plant salt stress.\nJ. of Sci. and Tech.

While desertification is increasing as result of climate change and human activities, is necessary to optimize soil and water usage, where stress-resistant crops are possible solutions.

The latest update suggested that the perpetual salinity problem claimed up to 900 million hectares of agricultural land worldwide, inducing salinity stress among salt-sensitive crops and ultimately reducing productivity and yield. Moreover, with the constant growth of the human population, sustainable solutions are vital to ensure food security and social welfare. Despite that, the current method of crop augmentations via selective breeding and genetic engineering only resulted in mild success. Therefore, using the biological approach of halotolerant plant growth-promoting bacteria (HT-PGPB) as bio-inoculants provides a promising crop enhancement strategy. HT-PGPB has been proven capable of forming a symbiotic relationship with the host plant by instilling induced salinity tolerance (IST) and multiple plant growth-promoting traits (PGP). Nevertheless, the mechanisms and prospects of HT-PGPB application of glycophytic rice crops remains incomprehensively reported. Thus, this review describes a plausible strategy of halophyte-associated HT-PGPB as the future catalyst for rice crop production in salt-dominated land and aims to meet the global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of zero hunger.</jats:p>",

Plant growth-promoting bacteria can be used to boost the growth of halophytes in saline soils. Salicornia is considered to be a promising salt-accumulating halophyte for capturing large amounts of carbon from the atmosphere. In addition, colonization and chemotaxis could play an important role in Salicornia-microbe interactions. In this study, the role of chemotaxis in the colonization of the halophilic siredophore-producing bacteria, Halomonas anticariensis FP35T, on Salicornia hispanica plants was investigated. The chemotactic response of FP35T to Salicornia root exudates showed optimum dependence at a salt concentration of 5 % NaCl (w/v). Oleanolic acid, the predominant compound in the exudates detected by HPLC and identified by UPLC-HRMS Q-TOF, acts as a chemoattractant. In vitro experiments demonstrated the enhanced positive effects of wild-type H. anticariensis strain FP35T on root length, shoot length, germination and the vigour index of S. hispanica. Furthermore, these positive effects partially depend on an active chemotaxis system, as the chemotaxis mutant H. anticariensis FP35 ΔcheA showed reduced plant growth promotion for all the parameters tested. Overall, our results suggest that chemotaxis responses to root exudates play an important role in interactions between Salicornia and halophilic bacteria, enhance their colonization and boost plant growth promotion. Preliminary results also indicate that root exudates have a positive impact on H. anticariensis FP35T biofilm formation under saline conditions, an effect which totally depends on the presence of the cheA gene.</jats:p>",

In this study, we introduce a new classification system grounded in the Statistical Rarity definition of extremophiles. To support this proposal, a comprehensive bibliographic survey of 1,298 species described as 'halophile', 'halophilic', or 'halotolerant' from 1967 to 2021 was conducted. Of these, 1,196 species with complete optimal NaCl growth data were analyzed using the Counting Method to determine species frequency across NaCl concentrations. Quartile metrics were applied to define new subclasses: halotolerant (&lt; 0.6 mol·L\n                  <sup>− 1</sup>\n                  NaCl), slight halophile (0.6–1.2 mol·L\n                  <sup>− 1</sup>\n                  ), moderate halophile (1.2–2.2 mol·L\n                  <sup>− 1</sup>\n                  ), and extreme halophile (&gt; 2.2 mol·L\n                  <sup>− 1</sup>\n                  ). The proposed system reclassifies a significant portion of species and emphasizes biological relevance by correlating rarity of optimal growth conditions with extremity. This paradigm shift addresses inconsistencies in halophile classification and standardizes the definition of halophilic and halotolerant microorganisms, providing theoretical meaning to those terms.\n                </p>"

I here present a brief obituary with special emphasis on Prof. Trüper’s contributions to our understanding of the halophilic prokaryotes and their adaptations to life in hypersaline environments. He has pioneered the study of the halophilic anoxygenic phototrophic sulfur bacteria of the Ectothiorhodospira—Halorhodospira group. Some of the species he and his group isolated from hypersaline and haloalkaline environments have become model organisms for the study of the mechanisms of haloadaptation: the functions of three major organic compounds – glycine betaine, ectoine, and trehalose – known to serve as “compatible solutes” in halophilic members of the Bacteria domain, were discovered during studies of these anoxygenic phototrophs. Prof. Trüper’s studies of hypersaline alkaline environments in Egypt also led to the isolation of the first known extremely halophilic archaeon (Natronomonas pharaonis). The guest editors dedicate this special volume of Life to the memory of Prof. Hans Georg Trüper.</jats:p>",

This selection was partly supported by literature searches, which showed that quats have been effective on Halanaerobium. ATP monitoring was then used to direct the success of a downhole biocide treatment program for horizontal wells. Since sessile samples were not routinely available, planktonic samples were used. Over two years of reviewing the treatment results of approximately 30 wells in a single lease, where multiple sample points were available, we found that most treatments were successful in returning/or maintaining wells within KPIs.

DHNs are rarely studied in halophytes, and their contribution to the mechanisms developed by these plants to survive in extreme conditions remains unknown. In this work, we carried out multiple genomic analyses of the conservation of halophytic DHN sequences to discover new segments, and examine their architectures, while comparing them with their orthologs in glycophytic plants. We performed an in silico analysis on 86 DHN sequences from 10 halophytic genomes. The phylogenetic tree showed that there are different distributions of the architectures among the different species, and that FSKn is the only architecture present in every plant studied. It was found that K-, F-, Y-, and S-segments are highly conserved in halophytes and glycophytes with a few modifications, mainly involving charged amino acids. Finally, expression data collected for three halophytic species (Puccinillia tenuiflora, Eutrema salsugenium, and Hordeum marinum) revealed that many DHNs are upregulated by salt stress, and the intensity of this upregulation depends on the DHN architecture.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>As an ecosystem of high socioeconomic and ecological importance, global loss and degradation of salt-marshes has multifaceted detrimental impacts. Salt-marshes are recognised as blue carbon ecosystems and play a notable role in the global carbon cycle, due to their enhanced ability to efficiently uptake and store organic carbon over long time scales. The characterisation of salt-marsh carbon sequestration capacity across spatial and temporal scales, however, is challenging due to the inherent complexities of the factors which dictate these processes. To capture the spatial variability, it is necessary to formulate relationships between halophyte specie above and below ground biomass and subsoil organic carbon content and then examine how this interacts with hydraulic regimes, geomorphological context and external pressures. In this study, seven typically occurring associations of halophyte species in the Venice Lagoon (Italy) were selected and the relative magnitude of above and below ground biomass as well as their relationship to soil organic carbon content was examined for each association. Specifically, the analysis examined measurements of AGB, BGB, LOI, SOC and Bulk Density at 54 sample sites over two different years for species associations dominated by Inula crithmoides, Sarcocornia fruticose, Juncus maritimus, Limonium narbonense, Spartina maritima, Spartina anglica, and Salicornia veneta. The results confirmed that the association type is influential and must be considered when mapping carbon sequestration capacity. The halophyte evolutionary differences paired with geomorphology and external forcings play a key role in determining the spatial variability of carbon sequestration capacity. Above ground biomass has a stepped increase on the transition between low and high marsh with the greatest densities being found in the high marsh, often adjacent to channels. Whereas, below ground biomass and soil organic carbon content peaked in the middle marsh zone. Furthermore, the below ground to above ground biomass ratio depends strongly on the association, the higher ratios being found in the low to middle marsh. Overall, the derived patterns in halophyte biomass and sequestration capacity across diverse associations of species is vital for predicting below ground biomass and organic carbon content based on above ground biomass. These results support salt-marsh monitoring and modelling endeavours, particularly in a sustainable coastal management and blue carbon assessment context.</jats:p>"

Viable cells of the strain reduced 200 µM Cr(VI) in basal medium for halophiles (MH) in 10 h and was inversely proportional to Cr(VI) concentrations. The rapid reduction by cells (10⁹ cells/mL) was achieved with 7.5% NaCl, at pH 7 and 37°C which increased with increasing cell density (10¹° cells/mL). While acetate, Cu³⁺, Fe³⁺, SO₄²⁻, and CO₃²⁻ were stimulating the reduction, the inhibitors retarded the process significantly. The NADH-dependent chromate reduction of the CFE was found to be constitutive with K<jats:sub>m</jats:sub> and V<jats:sub>max</jats:sub> values of 56.58 µM and 3.37 µM/min/mg protein respectively.

A higher concentration of CFE and electron donors increased the enzyme activity but was impacted negatively by toxic metals and anions.

The deduced AmyF shared very low sequence similarity (&lt;24%) with functionally characterized recombinant halophilic alpha- amylases. The recombinant alpha-amylase was successfully purified from Ni-NTA columns with a molecular mass of about 52 KDa on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The enzyme was active over a wide range of temperature (25–75 °C) and pH (4–9) with optimum activity at 45 °C and 7.5, respectively. Also, although it was active over a various concentrations of NaCl and KCl (0–4 M), increasing activity of the enzyme was observed with increasing concentration of these salts. Low concentrations of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion had no activating effect, but high concentrations of the ion (40 - 200 mM) enhanced activity of AmyF. The enzyme activity was increased by increasing concentrations of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Zn<sup>2+</sup>, Hg<sup>2+</sup> and Fe<sup>3+</sup>. However, it was inhibited only at very high concentrations of these metal ions. Cu<sup>2+</sup> did not decrease the amylase activity and the highest activity was observed at 100 mM of the ion. These properties indicate wide potential applications of this recombinant enzyme in starch processing industries.

By differential scanning calorimetry, the denaturation temperature of the halophilic holo- and apo-transaminase was determined to be 78.5 and 68.0 degrees C respectively at 3.3 M-KCl (pH 7.8). At low salt concentration the halophilic transaminase was inactivated, following first-order kinetics. The Km values for 2-oxoglutarate and L-aspartate, in 3 M-KCl (pH 7.8), were 0.75 mM and 12.6 mM respectively.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In today’s global scenario, chronic infections are common and often difficult to deal with. There has been a consistent surge in the number of chronic infections over the past decades. A variety of factors govern the onset and progression of infections. Biofilm is a conglomerate of different types of microbial cells. Biofilm formation has been observed to be one of the common aspects in a wide number of infections related to respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. Biofilm acts as a protective shield and offers a selective advantage to the pathogens to escape the host defense mechanism and the inhibitory impact of the antibiotics. There is a need to investigate methods to inhibit biofilm formation that could eventually aid in the treatment of an infection. Several methods to inhibit biofilm formation emphasize surface modification so that the organism is not able to adhere to the surface. Other methods consist of gene regulation and controlling the quorum sensing mechanisms governing biofilm formation. In this research, a biosurfactant, Rhamnolipid was obtained from a moderate halophile, Pseudomonas aeruginosa SH-6, and investigated for anti-biofilm potential. The emphasis was on clinically significant isolates known to synthesize biofilms. Appropriate controls were used, and a microtiter-well-based biofilm inhibition assay was conducted, using 0.1% Crystal violet for staining. It was found that Rhamnolipid (100mg/mL) was potent in inhibiting the biofilm of Pseudomonas aeruginosa MCC 2080 (ATCC 27853) with 60.51% ±1.27% (P-value &lt; .05) inhibition and biofilm of Staphylococcus aureus NCIM 5022 (ATCC 29213) with 32.24% ±1.35% (P-value &lt; .05) inhibition.</jats:p>",

A halophilic bacterial species has been isolated from salt‐tolerant plants, and when used as an inoculum stimulates growth of alfalfa in salty soil. The hypothesis is that the microbial inoculant induces gene expression changes in the plant, resulting in the increased growth of the plant in salt. To test this, RNA was isolated from inoculated and uninoculated alfalfa plants grown under saline conditions, with additional controls in the absence of salt. RNAseq analysis of these four treatments led to identification of differentially expressed genes (DEG). Several of these DEGs are being examined in more detail using quantitative reverse‐transcriptase PCR.

However, we report here that active in vitro protein synthesis occurred in 0.6 M or higher concentrations of Na2SO4, sodium formate, sodium acetate, sodium aspartate, or sodium glutamate, whereas 0.6 M NaF, NaCl, or NaBr completely inhibited protein synthesis as measured by polyuridylic acid-directed incorporation of [14C]phenylalanine. Sodium glutamate, sodium aspartate, and betaine (0.3 M) counteracted the inhibitory action of 0.6 M NaCl. The cell-associated Cl- concentration was 0.22 mol/kg in cells grown in 1.0 M NaCl. Of this, the free intracellular Cl- concentration was only 0.02 mol/kg. Cells contained 0.11 mol of glutamate per kg and small concentrations of other amino acids. All of the negative counterions for cell-associated Na+ and K+ have not yet been determined. In vitro protein synthesis by Escherichia coli was inhibited by sodium glutamate. Hybridization experiments with ribosomes and the soluble (S-100) fractions from extracts of E. coli and V. costicola showed that the glutamate-sensitive fraction was found in the soluble, not the ribosomal, part of the system. The phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase of V. costicola was not inhibited by 0.5 M or higher concentrations of NaCl; it was slightly more sensitive to high concentrations of sodium glutamate. Therefore, this enzyme was not responsible for the salt response of the V. costicola in vitro protein-synthesizing system.</jats:p>",

Therefore, magnesium sulfate and magnesium chloride were used to investigate the significant role played on carbonate minerals. In this study, Staphylococcus epidermidis Y2 was isolated and identified by 16S rDNA homology comparison. The ammonia, pH, carbonic anhydrase, carbonate and bicarbonate ions were investigated. The mineral phase, morphology and elemental composition were analyzed by XRD and SEM-EDS. The ultrathin slices of bacteria were analyzed by HRTEM-SAED and STEM. The result showed that this bacterium could release ammonia and carbonic anhydrase to increase pH, and elevate the supersaturation via a large number of carbonate and bicarbonate ions released through carbon dioxide hydration catalyzed by carbonic anhydrase. The crystal cell density of monohydrocalcite was lower in magnesium chloride medium than that in magnesium sulfate medium. The crystal grew in a mode of spiral staircas in magnesium sulfate medium, while in a concentric circular pattern in magnesium chloride medium. There was no obvious intracellular biomineralization. This study may be helpful to further understand the biomineralization mechanism, may also provide some references for the reconstruction of paleogeological environment.</jats:p>"

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The extreme halophile <jats:italic>Halobacterium species NRC-1</jats:italic> overcomes external near-saturating salt concentrations by accumulating intracellular salts comparable to those of the medium. This raises the fundamental question of how halophiles can maintain the specificity of protein–nucleic acid interactions that are particularly sensitive to high salts in mesophiles. Here we address the specificity of the essential aminoacylation reaction of the halophile, by focusing on molecular recognition of tRNA<jats:sup>Cys</jats:sup> by the cognate cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase. Despite the high salt environments of the aminoacylation reaction, and despite an unusual structure of the tRNA with an exceptionally large dihydrouridine loop, we show that aminoacylation of the tRNA proceeds with a catalytic efficiency similar to that of its mesophilic counterparts. This is manifested by an essentially identical <jats:italic>K</jats:italic><jats:sub>m</jats:sub> for tRNA to those of the mesophiles, and by recognition of the same nucleotide determinants that are conserved in evolution. Interestingly, aminoacylation of the halophile tRNA<jats:sup>Cys</jats:sup> is more closely related to that of bacteria than eukarya by placing a strong emphasis on features of the tRNA tertiary core. This suggests an adaptation to the highly negatively charged tRNA sugar-phosphate backbone groups that are the key elements of the tertiary core.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>When illuminated, washed cell suspensions of Ectothiorhodospira halophila carry out a concentrative uptake of glutamate or proline. Dark-exposed cells accumulate glutamate but not proline. Proline transport was strongly inhibited by carbonylcyanide-m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), a proton permeant that uncouples photophosphorylation, and by 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-n-oxide (HQNO), an inhibitor of photosynthetic electron transport. A stimulation of proline uptake was effected by N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD), an inhibitor of membrane adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) which catalyzes the phosphorylation. These findings suggest that the driving force for proline transport is the proton-motive force established during photosynthetic electron transport. Glutamate uptake in the light was inhibited by CCCP and HQNO, but to a lesser extent than was the proline system. DCCD caused a mild inhibition of glutamate uptake in the light, but strongly inhibited the uptake by dark-exposed cells. CCCP strongly inhibited glutamate uptake in the dark. The light-dependent transport of glutamate is apparently driven by the proton-motive force established during photosynthetic electron transport. Hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by membrane ATPase apparently establishes the proton-motive force to drive the light-independent transport. These conclusions were supported by demonstrating that light- or dark-exposed cells accumulate [3H]triphenylmethylphosphonium, a lipid-soluble cation. Several lines of indirect evidence indicated that the proline system required higher levels of energy than did the glutamate system(s). This could explain why ATP hydrolysis does not drive proline transport in the dark. Membrane vesicles were prepared by the sonic treatment of E. halophila spheroplasts. The vesicles contained active systems for the uptake of proline and glutamate.</jats:p>",

With ∼6000 worldwide and over 420 Tunisian species, halophytes represent a huge potential in several fields, including desalination, phytoremediation, agrofarming, medicinal use, industrial applications, pharmacology and even nanotechnology. We describe the practical and technical steps followed and bioinformatics tools used to conceive and design the first Tunisian halophytes database, enabling species identification and characterization. As a first version, information about botany, morphology, ecophysiology and biochemistry were provided for the identified species with their sites of growing in Tunisia, first step of biodiversity conservation, management and valorization. The database will be regularly maintained, updated and enriched to achieve the goal of whole Tunisian halophyte species and fit the needs of scientists and all category of users.Database URL: http://halophytes.rnrt.tn/</jats:p>",

Greenhouse transplants from the Tall, Very Tall, and Edge populations proved to be plastic in their growth responses depending on their time of transplant.

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n          <jats:p>Rapid population growth in the less developed countries of arid and semiarid regions and concomitant decline in productivity of agricultural lands due to shortage of good-quality irrigation water and increasing soil salinity, are exerting enormous pressure on the dwindling supplies of human consumption for food. Equally or even more affected in some cases are other resources, such as fodder for animals and fuel wood for the rural poor. There is growing evidence that this trend is unlikely to reverse at least in the near future. The last quarter of the 20th century has seen an explosion of information leading to a better understanding of the biology of salt tolerance in plants. Most conventional crops have marginal salt tolerance and there is a need to explore alternate options for utilization of salt-affected lands and saline water resources. Research has indicated the potential of many halophytes to withstand high soil salinity and saline water irrigation, some even with seawater. This tolerance is achieved through a number of adaptations such as selective uptake and transport of ions, localization of ions in vacuoles, synthesis of compatible organic solutes for cytoplasmic balancing and protection of enzyme systems. As a consequence, these plants are able to reduce damage and exhibit sustained growth by establishing homeostatic conditions. A wealth of halophytic flora exists which can be exploited for an array of uses like food, fodder, fuel wood, oilseed, medicines, chemicals, landscaping, ornamentals, and environment conservation through carbon sequestration.</jats:p>",

As the pH of the medium was adjusted from 5.7 to 9.0, the proton motive force steadily decreased from about 170 to 100 mV. This decline occurred, despite a large increase in the membrane potential to its maximum value at pH 9.0, because of the loss of the pH gradient (inside alkaline). The cytoplasm and medium were of equal pH at 7.5; membrane permeability properties were lost at the pH extremes of 5.0 and 9.5. Protonophores and monensin prevented the net efflux of protons normally found when an oxygen pulse was given to an anaerobic cell suspension. A Na+/H+ antiport activity was measured for both Na+ influx and efflux and was shown to be dissipated by protonophores and monensin. These results strongly favor the concept that respiratory energy is used for proton efflux and that the resulting proton motive force may be converted to a sodium motive force through Na+/H+ antiport (driven by delta psi). A role for antiport activity in pH regulation of the cytosol can also explain the broad pH range for optimal growth, extending to the alkaline extreme of pH 9.0.</jats:p>",

NaCl did not activate and was instead a mixed-type inhibitor towards NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>Cl or KCl. The salt concentration affected the kinetic parameters of the reaction. The apparent K<jats:sub>m</jats:sub> for L-malate reached a minimal value at about 0.1 M salt; the value for NADP, on the other hand, increased continuously with the salt concentration. The reaction also required a divalent cation activator, Mn<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> being better than Co<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> or Mg<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>. NADH was a mixed-type inhibitor towards both substrates, whereas oxaloacetate was strictly competitive towards L-malate and non-competitive towards NADP. The inhibition kinetics were sigmoidal for NADH and hyperbolic for oxaloacetate. The malic enzyme from V. costicola was similar to those of a marine Pseudomonas and Halobacterium cutirubrum in kinetic and regulatory properties but showed a response to salts intermediate between those of the latter enzymes. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Salinization of soil and water can pose a serious threat for irrigated agricultural lands in arid and semi-arid regions because high concentrations of salt can negatively impact crop production, and consequently, the agricultural economy. Halophytes are highly salt-tolerant plants that may provide a viable option for cultivation in saline areas, enabling economic production from previously unproductive land. Many halophytes can be used for human consumption, forage for livestock, or biofuel production. These plants may also remediate saline soils by taking up salt from the soil, thereby improving conditions for conventional crop production. This project looked at growth of two halophytic crops, AC Saltlander green wheatgrass (Elymus hoffmannii) and Rainbow quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa var. rainbow) under different salt stresses in a greenhouse experiment. We cultivated the crops in a greenhouse with crossed saline soil (2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 dS/m) and irrigation (1, 2, 4, and 6 dS/m) treatments. We measured plant height approximately bi-weekly until harvest. A subset of harvested biomass, roots and soil subsamples were analyzed for nutrient and salt content. Quinoa and AC Saltlander aboveground biomass were larger for soil salinities greater than 2 dS/m, with maximum measured biomass after harvest of more than 5 g for quinoa, and more than 12 g for AC Saltlander. Quinoa height was greatest on most dates for soil salinity of 4 dS/m. There was a significant relationship between increased soil salinity and Cl content of quinoa plant tissues, roots, and soil at harvest, but irrigation salinity had no significant effects on analyzed quinoa variables. AC Saltlander root biomass decreased with increasing soil salinity, but had greatest root biomass at the 2 and 6 dS/m irrigation salinities (the smallest and greatest irrigation salinity treatments). AC Saltlander aboveground biomass chemistry (i.e., Ca, Na, and Cl) responded significantly to differences in soil chemistry. Similarly, AC Saltlander aboveground biomass Ca, Na, S, and Cl was significantly affected by irrigation salinity. Overall, both halophytes germinated, grew, and produced seeds in the greenhouse experiment on saline Nevada soils, so they may be options for alternative crops on marginal lands in Nevada with moderately saline irrigation water.</jats:p>",

Two new Neocamarosporium species, viz. N. halocnemi and N. suaedae, are described and illustrated based on molecular and morphological data. In the phylogenetic tree, both new species formed distinct lineages from previously known species of Neocamarosporium. Neocamarosporium halocnemi differs from N. suaedae by having longer ellipsoid and oblong conidia and some pycnidia with 1–2 short necks.

Dumort], a perennial, edible Mediterranean halophytic specie, is recognised for its richness in biologically active compounds and its associated health benefits. Despite its potential, it remains largely underexplored in Croatia. This study investigates the effect of plant’s phenological stage—vegetative phase (June), pre-flowering (July), and full flowering (August)—on its phenolic profile (total phenolics, flavonoids, and tannins using spectrophotometry, and individual phenolic compounds using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography and antioxidant potential (using three complementary in vitro assays)). Total phenolics, flavonoids and related antioxidant activity progressively increased from June to August. Among the 18 identified phenolic compounds, chlorogenic acid was the most abundant (355 to 455 µg/g), reaching its highest concentration in the August sample, while among flavonoids it was quercetin (32 to 34 µg/g). These findings suggest that golden samphire collected in the late summer flowering stage exhibits the highest phenolic and antioxidant potential, and that chlorogenic acid, likely acting in synergy with other phenolics, may play the key role in the plant’s biological activity, reinforcing its potential for future applications.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In vitro protein synthesis was studied in extracts of the moderate halophile Vibrio costicola by using as mRNAs the endogenous mRNA of V. costicola and the RNA of the R17 bacteriophage of Escherichia coli. Protein synthesis (amino acid incorporation) was dependent on the messenger, ribosomes, soluble cytoplasmic factors, energy source, and tRNA(FMet) (in the R17 RNA system) and was inhibited by certain antibiotics. These properties indicated de novo protein synthesis. In the V. costicola system directed by R17 RNA, a protein of the same electrophoretic mobility as the major coat protein of the R17 phage was synthesized. Antibiotic action and the response to added tRNA(FMet) showed that protein synthesis in the R17 RNA system, but not in the endogenous messenger system, absolutely depended on initiation. Optimal activity of both systems was observed in 250 to 300 mM NH4+ (as glutamate). Higher salt concentrations, especially those with Cl- as anion, were generally inhibitory. The R17 RNA-directed system was more sensitive to Cl- ions than the endogenous system was. Glycine betaine stimulated both systems and partly overcame the toxic effects of Cl- ions. Both systems required Mg2+, but in lower concentrations than the polyuridylic acid-directed system previously studied. Initiation factors were removed from ribosomes by washing with 3.0 to 3.5 M NH4Cl, concentrations about three times as high as that needed to remove initiation factors from E. coli ribosomes. Washing with 4.0 M NH4Cl damaged V. costicola ribosomes, although the initiation factors still functioned. Cl- ions inhibited the attachment of initiation factors to tRNA(FMet) but had little effect on binding of initiation factors to R17 RNA.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In vitro protein synthesis in Vibrio costicola [poly(U)-directed incorporation of phenylalanine] was studied. The extent of protein synthesis was limited by the number of ribosomes present. Density gradient centrifugation experiments suggested that, after runoff of ribosomes from the artificial messenger, the 50S subunit was unable to attach to the 30S-messenger complex. As shown previously (M. Kamekura and D. J. Kushner, J. Bacteriol. 160:385-390, 1984), Cl- ions inhibited protein synthesis; indeed, the highest rate of synthesis took place in the lowest attainable Cl- concentration (37 mM). The inhibitory effects were partly reversed by glutamate and betaine, both of which are concentrated within cells of V. costicola. The strongest reversal was seen when both glutamate and betaine were present. Cl- ions can prevent binding of ribosomes to poly(U) and displace ribosomes already bound to this artificial messenger. The effects of Cl- ions on binding were also reversed by glutamate and betaine. Cl- ions did not affect accuracy of translation; they were shown previously (Kamekura and Kushner, J. Bacteriol. 160:385-390, 1984) not to affect phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase. It was also found that washing ribosomes with inhibitory NaCl concentrations did not interfere with their ability to carry out protein synthesis later in optimal (low) salt concentrations. On the contrary, these ribosomes were more active than before they were washed. We conclude that the main site of action of Cl- in the system studied is on the binding of ribosomes to the mRNA.</jats:p>",

These remarkable plants have developed various strategies to tolerate salinity and thrive in high-salt environments. At the appropriate levels, salt has a beneficial effect on the vegetative growth of halophytes but inhibits the growth of non-halophytes. In recent years, many studies have focused on elucidating the salt-tolerance mechanisms of halophytes at the molecular, physiological, and individual level. In this review, we focus on the mechanisms, from the macroscopic to the molecular, underlying the successful growth of halophytes in saline environments to explain why salt has beneficial effects on halophytes but harmful effects on non-halophytes. These mechanisms include the specialized organs of halophytes (for example, ion compartmentalization in succulent leaves), their unique structures (salt glands and hydrophobic barriers in roots), and their salt-tolerance genes. We hope to shed light on the use of halophytes for engineering salt-tolerant crops, soil conservation, and the protection of freshwater resources in the near future.</jats:p>",

However, this halophyte shrub also had a high Na content (~7%) exceeding the requirements of the animals, and which could limit its DM intake and digestibility.

Such a reaction is of considerable interest for biotechnological applications in that transgenic plants engineered with bacterial glycine-betaine-synthesizing enzymes have been shown to have enhanced tolerance towards various environmental stresses, such as hypersalinity, freezing, and high temperatures. To date, choline dehydrogenase has been poorly characterized in its biochemical and kinetic properties, mainly because its purification has been hampered by instability of the enzyme in vitro.

By way of contrast, the halophyte Suaeda maritima accumulates, without injury, concentrations of the order of 400 mm NaCl in its leaves. Here we report that cAMP and Ca2+ (blockers of nonselective cation channels) and Li+ (a competitive inhibitor of Na+ uptake) did not have any significant effect on the uptake of Na+ by the halophyte S. maritima when plants were in 25 or 150 mm NaCl (150 mm NaCl is near optimal for growth). However, the inhibitors of K+ channels, TEA+ (10 mm), Cs+ (3 mm), and Ba2+ (5 mm), significantly reduced the net uptake of Na+ from 150 mm NaCl over 48 h, by 54%, 24%, and 29%, respectively. TEA+ (10 mm), Cs+ (3 mm), and Ba2+ (1 mm) also significantly reduced 22Na+ influx (measured over 2 min in 150 mm external NaCl) by 47%, 30%, and 31%, respectively. In contrast to the situation in 150 mm NaCl, neither TEA+ (1–10 mm) nor Cs+ (0.5–10 mm) significantly reduced net Na+ uptake or 22Na+ influx in 25 mm NaCl. Ba2+ (at 5 mm) did significantly decrease net Na+ uptake (by 47%) and 22Na+ influx (by 36% with 1 mm Ba2+) in 25 mm NaCl. K+ (10 or 50 mm) had no effect on 22Na+ influx at concentrations below 75 mm NaCl, but the influx of 22Na+ was inhibited by 50 mm K+ when the external concentration of NaCl was above 75 mm. The data suggest that neither nonselective cation channels nor a low-affinity cation transporter are major pathways for Na+ entry into root cells. We propose that two distinct low-affinity Na+ uptake pathways exist in S. maritima: Pathway 1 is insensitive to TEA+ or Cs+, but sensitive to Ba2+ and mediates Na+ uptake under low salinities (25 mm NaCl); pathway 2 is sensitive to TEA+, Cs+, and Ba2+ and mediates Na+ uptake under higher external salt concentrations (150 mm NaCl). Pathway 1 might be mediated by a high-affinity K transporter-type transporter and pathway 2 by an AKT1-type channel.</jats:p>",

The effect of ionization of the primary and secondary acidic functions of the phosphate groups of the two lipids on surface characteristics of compression isotherms was determined by spreading monolayers on subphases with pH values ranging from below the apparent pKa of the primary ionization (pH 0) to greater than that of secondary ionization (pH 10.9). The limiting molecular area increases with decreasing pH below 2. Ionization of the primary phosphate functions of both phospholipids (with bulk pK1 values close to 4) is associated with a marked expansion of the films, as judged by values of limiting molecular area. Ionization of the secondary phosphate functions causes further expansion of the films, with the apparent pK2 of deoxyphosphatidylglycerol phosphate slightly less than that indicated for phosphatidylglycerol phosphate. Values of surface-compressibility modulus calculated from the surface characteristics of the phosphatidylglcerol phosphate monolayers showed that films spread on subphases with a pH of about the apparent pK1 of the primary phosphate functions were the least compressible. Increasing or decreasing subphase pH caused an increase in compressibility; this effect on compressibility was much less with monolayers of deoxyphosphatidylglycerol phosphate at high pH. The effect of inorganic counter-ions on monolayer characteristics of phosphatidylglycerol phosphate was examined by using subphases of NaCl concentrations varying from 0.01 to 1 M. The limiting molecular area was found to increase exponentially with respect to the subphase NaCl concentration.</jats:p>",

This study aimed to comprehensively assess the nutritional composition and phytochemical content of Suaeda maritima, exploring its potential as a dietary resource and source of bioactive compounds.\nObjectives: To analyze and compare the nutritional composition, phytochemical content, and antioxidant properties of fresh and dried Suaeda maritima samples. The investigation sought to determine the impact of the drying process on the plant's nutritive value and bioactive compounds.\nMethods: Fresh and dried Suaeda maritima samples were recruited for nutritional analysis which includes carbohydrates, proteins, fats, dietary fiber, minerals, and sodium content per 100 grams. Phytochemical content and antioxidant properties were assessed through total phenolics, total flavonoids, and antioxidant assays (DPPH and TBARS).\nResults: The results indicated that Suaeda maritima possesses significant nutritional value which contains carbohydrates, proteins, dietary fiber, essential minerals, and low-fat content in fresh and dried forms. Importantly, no statistically significant differences (p &gt; 0.05) were observed between fresh and dried samples regarding macronutrients and minerals, suggesting effective preservation of nutritional value during drying. However, notable distinctions were found in the phytochemical content and antioxidant properties. Fresh Suaeda maritima exhibited significantly higher levels of total phenolics and flavonoids than dried samples. Additionally, DPPH and TBARS assays identified that the antioxidant activities were more noticeable in fresh samples and allow to understand their health-promoting potential.\nConclusion: Suaeda maritima demonstrated substantial nutritional value with significant levels of carbohydrates, proteins, dietary fiber, essential minerals, and minimal fat content. The drying process effectively preserved its nutritional composition but it reduced phytochemical content and antioxidant activities. Careful consideration of processing techniques is essential to maximize the retention of health-promoting compounds, especially for applications in the nutraceutical and pharmaceutical industries.</jats:p>",

Fresh cell suspensions rapidly accumulated 8-14C-labeled adenine 5'-nucleotides and adenosine.

Furthermore, the uptake of nucleotides had Mg2+ requirements similar to those of the 5'-nucleotidase. The uptake of ATP was competitively inhibited by unlabeled adenosine and vice versa; inhibition of the adenosine uptake by ATP occurred only in the presence of Mg2+. These experiments indicated that nucleotides were dephosphorylated to adenosine before uptake. The hydrolysis of [alpha-32P]ATP as well as the uptake of free adenosine followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The kinetics of uptake of ATP, ADP, and AMP also each appeared to be a saturable carrier-mediated transport. The kinetic properties of the uptake of ATP were compared with those of the ATP hydrolysis and the uptake of adenosine. It was concluded that the adenosine moiety of ATP was taken up via a specific adenosine transport system after dephosphorylation by the 5'-nucleotidase.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Marine litter and microplastic contamination are severe dangers to aquatic ecosystems. The interaction between halophyte plants and micro/nanoplastics has recently gained attention. Halophyte plants and maritime macroalgae are capable of trapping substantial volumes of marine debris, leading to areas of buildup, known as ‘sinks’, of anthropogenic particles. The review of existing studies exposes that halophyte plants can serve as sinks for micro-nano plastics by absorbing them on their surface. Moreover, these plastics can be absorbed by plants. Plastic on the surfaces and within plant tissue can cause various harmful effects. The present review highlights an understanding of microplastic abundance, bioavailability, influencing factors, technological detection, and potential salt-tolerant plants for bioremediation. According to these findings, we advocate the addition of microplastic on halophyte plants and algae in prospective monitoring studies, describe acceptable methodologies, and advise doing exposure studies alongside risk assessments, strategies for preventing and controlling policies of these underestimated pollutants in vegetated coastal ecosystems and establishes a basis for future research.</jats:p>",

Compared with other, non-halophilic, PEPCKs, the enzyme from V. costicola had a significantly lower total content of hydrophobic amino acids. The contents of glycine and serine were higher in the V. costicola enzyme (16.7 and 10.22% respectively) than in the non-halophilic PEPCKs (6.8-9.6% and 4.67-6.28% respectively). These results resemble those obtained by De Médicis &amp; Rossignol [(1979) Experientia 35, 1546-1547] with the pyruvate kinase from V. costicola, and agree with the proposal by Lanyi [(1974) Bacteriol. Rev. 38, 272-290] of partial replacement of hydrophobic amino acids by glycine and serine to maintain the balance between hydrophobic and hydrophilic forces in halophilic enzymes. In agreement with this ‘halophilic’ characteristic, the PEPCK was somewhat stabilized by 1 M-KCl or -NaCl and by 20% (v/v) glycerol, and its oxaloacetate-decarboxylation and 14CO2-oxaloacetate-exchange reactions were activated by KCl and NaCl up to 1 M, whereas the fixation of CO2 on PEP had a maximum at 0.025-0.05 M salt. These facts suggest that the salts, at concentrations probably physiological for the bacterium, increase the formation of the complex of oxaloacetate and ATP with the enzyme, and the liberation of the products, PEP and ADP, thus favouring PEP synthesis.</jats:p>",

The purified newly isolated phytase from the halophilic Cobetia marina strain 439 appears to be appropriate for use as an additive in food and feed processing. Its molecular weight was determined to be 43 kDa by gel filtration and 40 kDa by SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The purified enzyme had maximum activity at pH 8.0 and 45 °C, while at 70 °C, it was 80% and about 50% at 80 °C for 40 min, showing its thermostability. Enzyme activity was retained at a broad pH range from 6.5 to 9.0. The half-life of the phytase of 15 min at pH 10 and 30 min at pH 4.0 was registered. The enzyme was proven to be with high substrate specificity. In addition, the purified phytase showed strong proteolytic tolerance against trypsin and pepsin. The pH profile, its thermostability, and proteolytic tolerance of the studied phytase as a halophilic bacterial product determine it as a unique candidate for application in agriculture, food, and feed industries.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Biodiesel fuel, mainly produced from edible vegetable oils, has been proposed as a renewable substitute for petroleum diesel. However, there is growing concern about its role in rising food prices, accelerating deforestation, and displacing existing agricultural production. Moreover, given the progressive shortages of freshwater resources and arable land, a major target of investigations is to evaluate the potential utilization of promising salt-tolerant halophytic non-food crops for the sustainable production of oil-rich biomass, which will be converted to fuel. In this paper, an attempt has been made to look into the potential of the exploitation of native halophytic plants in European and Mediterranean arid or semi-arid lands that can prosper in seawater or brackish waters for diesel production in Europe. Fatty acid (FA) profiles of seed oils of 37 European and Mediterranean halophytic plant species including some of cosmopolitan distribution were examined. The saponification number, iodine value (IV), cetane index (CI), and gross heat of combustion of FA methyl esters (FAMEs) of oils were calculated from reported FAMEs compositions, and they varied from 165.3 to 193.3, from 71.8 to 173.7, from 35.9 to 60.0, and from 39.86 to 40.41 MJ/kg, respectively. FA seed oil content and composition, IV, CI, linolenic acid ME, and polyunsaturated ME (with ≥4 double bonds) contents were used to predict the quality of FAME of oil for use as biodiesel, according to EN 14214 European standard. Crithmum maritimum and Crambe maritima, having more than 30 % fixed oil in their seeds, were found most suitable as alternative vegetable oil sources for the production of biodiesel.</jats:p>",

The plant powder characteristics were also elucidated. The physicochemical analyses were done by using WHO recommended parameters such as loss on drying, ash values (total ash, water soluble ash, acid insoluble ash, sulphated ash, carbonated ash, nitrated ash), extractive values. The qualitative phytochemical analysis revealed the presence of saponins, steroids and coumarins in maximum amount in crude as well as in various solvent extracts. The morphological studies exhibited the organoleptic and surface characteristics of the plant and its parts. The microscopic study showed the presence of various characteristics of whole plant like palisade tissue, metaxylem, protoxylem, phloem showed companion cells, bicollateral type of vascular bundles, parenchyma, rosette calcium oxalate crystals and paracytic stomata. The pharmacognostic characters enlisted in this study will help in identification of the crude drug; the standardization parameters laid down will ensure the efficacy of drug and also distinguish the drug from its adulterants.

Vast areas of saline deserts exist in arid areas of India where crop production is not feasible. One of the ways to effectively utilise such landscape is to use plant species adapted to such hostile environments. Field survey was carried out in two major saline desert ecosystem of western India, namely Great Rann of Kachchh (GRK) and Little Rann of Kachchh (LRK), during 2013 and 2014. The study indicated that these unique ecosystems were deficient in soil organic carbon with content less than 0.77%. Extremes of salinity are common in the study area recording salinity as high as 102.3 dS m-1 in GRK and 85.38 dS m-1 in LRK. The major halophytic plants were Aeluropus lagopoides, Sporobolus marginatus, Suaeda nudiflora and Cressa cretica. Aeluropus was able to grow in soils having salinity upto 27.7 dS m-1, whereas Sporobolus could grow in ecological niches with salinity as high as 83.1 dS m-1. The halophytic non grasses like Suaeda and Cressa were widely distributed in both the saline desert ecosystems. The presence of salts increased the plant population of Suaeda and Cressa up to certain salinity levels. Beyond salinity value of 9.9 dS m-1, the plant density of Suaeda decreased, whereas in Cressa, the salinity value beyond which reduction in population decreased was 27.2 dS m-1. These plants which are able to survive at extremely salinity environments, could be explored for greening saline deserts and could be used as local fodder resource to support livestock population.Key words: Aeluropus lagopoides, Cressa cretica, salinity, soluble ions, Sporobolus marginatus, Suaeda nudiflora.</jats:p>",

Effective mitigation and recovery strategies are vital for sustaining food production, especially in the context of climate change. Halophytic plants, such as Atriplex nummularia, have shown potential for remediating saline soils, but their application remains limited. An alternative approach involves leveraging microorganisms adapted to saline environments to enhance plant stress tolerance. In this study, we investigated the microbiome of A. nummularia under saline and non-saline irrigation conditions to identify extremophilic microorganisms that promote salt stress tolerance. Through 16S rRNA analysis, we identified members of the genus Haladaptatus exclusively in the rhizosphere of salt-irrigated plants. These microorganisms were isolated and inoculated into maize crop systems to evaluate their ability to confer salt tolerance. Our results demonstrate that Haladaptatus strains significantly enhance salinity tolerance in maize, with a marked increase in the relative abundance of archaeal 16S rRNA in soils as NaCl irrigation levels rise. This study provides the first evidence that Haladaptatus, an archaeon isolated from the rhizosphere of a halophyte, can significantly enhance salt tolerance in an agriculturally important crop. These findings suggest a promising biotechnological application for improving crop resilience in saline environments, offering a sustainable strategy for addressing soil salinization and securing food production in the context of global climate challenges.</p>"

The plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae commonly known as Sedge family. The leaf and stem was evaluated macroscopically and microscopically. Preliminary qualitative phytochemical analysis, physicochemical analysis which included loss on drying, ash values and extractive values and fluroscence analysis were done in accordance with WHO guidelines for identification and standardization of C. conglomerates. The morphological studies exhibited the organoleptic and surface characteristics of whole plant like the leaf was simple, alternate, elongated lanceolate, entire margin, acute apex, parallel veination. The microscopic and powder microscopic study showed the presence of various characteristics like parenchyma cells, spiral vessels, annular vessels, parallel venation, gramineous stomata, conjoint collateral vascular bundle, etc. The phytochemical analysis revealed the plant to be rich in steroids and triterpenes. The extractive value was maximum in methanol solvent indicating presence of more polar compounds. The fluorescence analysis under visible light &amp; under UV light by treatment with different chemical reagents showed characteristic colour changes. The standards laid down will be helpful to ensure the efficacy, safety and purity of medicinal halophytic plant C. conglomerates. The parameters established in this study are useful for the preparation of a monograph of this plant.</jats:p>",

The results indicate that germinated seeds of four investigated tree species were inhibited at different saline levels. Germination speed and seed vigour, which were indicated by germination index and vigour index, decreased with increase in salt stress, whereas different descending patterns were observed among all the seeds. The salt-resistant capacity of seeds in four tree species was arranged in numerical order by their relative germination percentage and vigour index; however, they could not be clearly identified from each other when NaCl levels were 50 and 200 mM. At 100 mM NaCl, salt-tolerance was ranked from highest to lowest as follows: P. elliottii, F. chinensis, P. taeda and L. indica. However, P. elliottii ranked lower than F. chinensis at 150 mM NaCl, indicating that F. chinensis exhibited better adaptation to salt stress than P. elliottii.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The importance of green technologies is steadily growing. Salt-tolerant plants have been proposed as energy crops for cultivation on saline lands. Halophytes such as Salicornia europaea, Tripolium pannonicum, Crithmum maritimum and Chenopodium quinoa, among many other species, can be cultivated in saline lands, in coastal areas or for treating saline wastewater, and the biomass might be used for biogas production as an integrated process of biorefining. However, halophytes have different salt tolerance mechanisms, including compartmentalization of salt in the vacuole, leading to an increase of sodium in the plant tissues. The sodium content of halophytes may have an adverse effect on the anaerobic digestion process, which needs adjustments to achieve stable and efficient conversion of the halophytes into biogas. This review gives an overview of the specificities of halophytes that needs to be accounted for using their biomass as feedstocks for biogas plants in order to expand renewable energy production. First, the different physiological mechanisms of halophytes to grow under saline conditions are described, which lead to the characteristic composition of the halophyte biomass, which may influence the biogas production. Next, possible mechanisms to avoid negative effects on the anaerobic digestion process are described, with an overview of full-scale applications. Taking all these aspects into account, halophyte plants have a great potential for biogas and methane production with yields similar to those produced by other energy crops and the simultaneous benefit of utilization of saline soils.</jats:p>",

Seeds of S. iberica were germinated at various temperatures and at various salinities in a 12 h light : 12 h dark photoperiod to determine their germinability under these conditions. Increases in NaCl concentration progressively inhibited seed germination. Few seeds germinated at 1000 mM NaCl. Cooler temperatures significantly inhibited germination, while high night (25°C) and high day (35°C) temperature regimes showed higher germination. Rate of germination decreased with an increase in salinity. Germination rate was higher at 2535°C and lower at 515°C temperatures. Seeds were transferred from salt solutions to distilled water after 20 days, and those from low salinities recovered quickly at cooler temperature regimes. Recovery germination percentages substantially decreased with an increase in salinity and temperature.Key words: halophyte, recovery of seed germination, Salsola iberica, salt desert, thermoperiod, Utah. </jats:p>",

Surprisingly, under 100 mM NaCl conditions, the primary roots elongated much faster than under NaCl-free conditions, although up to 200 mM those were reduced. On the other hand, iso-osmotic mannitol did not promote primary root elongation, suggesting a specific response to NaCl. Epidermal cell elongation was promoted in the elongation zone, but meristem size and DNA replication were decreased. In addition, root hair formation and lateral root elongation were suppressed at moderate salinity. Compared with\n                  <jats:italic>A. thaliana</jats:italic>\n                  , the cell death and ROS increase of root tip meristem cells under 100 mM NaCl condition were significantly lower in\n                  <jats:italic>S. parvula</jats:italic>\n                  seedlings. The size and starch content of sedimentary amyloplasts/statoliths in columella cells decreased, and gravitropism of primary roots was partially reduced. Gene expression analyses showed that the expression of auxin response and biosynthesis genes\n                  <jats:italic>IAA1, IAA2, TAA1</jats:italic>\n                  and\n                  <jats:italic>YUC8</jats:italic>\n                  were repressed and the\n                  <jats:italic>SOS1</jats:italic>\n                  gene was upregulated two-fold in roots grown under moderate salt conditions. Proteomic analysis showed that co-chaperone and activator of HSPs such as Hop2 and Aha1 domain-containing protein orthologs were upregulated. Moreover, several secondary metabolic process-related proteins, antioxidant proteins, stress response proteins and proline catabolic process-related proteins were also increased.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In the electron microscope, isolated cell envelopes of the extremely halophilic bacterium, Halobacterium cutirubrum, have the same hexagonal surface pattern and roughly the same shape as do intact cells. At different pH values and in different ionic environments the envelopes undergo changes in shape and surface structure similar to those of intact cells. These changes are probably not due to osmotic pressure. In media of low ionic strength envelopes disintegrate. This disintegration appears to involve at least two reactions, both temperature-dependent.Chemical analyses show that envelopes consist mainly of lipoprotein. Both lipid and protein components are negatively charged at neutral pH, and this may help to explain the dependence on high cationic concentrations for envelope stability. Most of the cell\"s phosphatides are present in the envelope. The main phosphorus-containing components of cells are acid-soluble compounds and nucleic acids, whereas the main phosphorus-containing components of envelopes are phosphatides. Envelopes also contain small amounts of hexoses, hexosamine(s), and nucleic acids with a higher RNA/DNA ratio than found in intact cells, but neither muramic acid nor diaminopimelic acid was present. The lack of muramic acid in H. cutirubrum indicates that this halophile does not have a rigid mucopeptide wall of the type found in other bacteria. The lack of mucopeptide in envelopes is not due to autolytic digestion of mucopeptide during envelope isolation.</jats:p>",

It contributes to the stabilization of volatile sandy substrate, facilitating the colonization of other species. The present study determined the reaction of two types of explant: apical shoot fragments and fragments from a lower portion of the shoot. Apical shoot fragments were used to propagate and root sea sandwort plants due to the positive impact on the development of shoots and roots. Regardless of the plant growth regulators applied in the medium, the lateral meristems on the explants from the lower parts of the shoot stopped growing, and then yellowed and died out. Apical fragments of shoots developed higher and more numerous shoots and longer and more numerous roots than explants, which were fragments collected from lower parts of shoots. The findings indicated that propagation should be conducted on Murashige and Skoog medium with the addition of 1 mg∙dm−3 kinetin, whereas shoots with their apical fragments should be rooted with the addition of 1.5 mg∙dm−3 1-naphthaleneacetic acid. The results also showed that the addition of NaCl at concentrations of 25 and 50 mM did not restrict their growth, thereby indicating the tolerance of the plant to soil salinity. However, an increase in the concentration of NaCl in the medium to 75 mM restricted the development of plants, and the shoots were lower and roots were shorter and less numerous.</jats:p>",

Higher concentrations of all of the uncouplers were required to inhibit transport at pH 8.5 than at pH 7.0. The protonophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone showed the greatest reduction in inhibitory capacity as the pH was increased, carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone showed less reduction, and 3,3',4',5-tetrachlorosalicylanilide was almost as effective as an inhibitor of amino acid transport at pH 8.5 as at pH 7.0 for all of the organisms except A. haloplanktis 214. Differences between the protonophores in their relative activities at pHs 7.0 and 8.5 were attributed to differences in their pK values. 3,3',4',5-Tetrachlorosalicylanilide, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide, and NaCN all inhibited Na+ extrusion from Na+-loaded cells of V. alginolyticus 118 at pH 8.5. The results support the conclusion that Na+ extrusion from this organism at pH 8.5 occurs as a result of Na+/H+ antiport activity.

Besides, the in vitro antioxidant activities of plant extracts were assessed (total antioxidant and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH)-scavenging bioassays). Of the 12 species, Galium arenarium, Convolvulus soldanella and Eryngium campestre exhibited the most protective action on MDBK and IPEC-J2 cells against zearalenone (ZEN) or T2 toxin contamination (restoring about 75% of cell viability at 10 μg·mL−1) without inflammation response.

A bio-guided study showed that fractions of G. arenarium extract protect MDBK cells against T2 or ZEN toxicity and several major compounds like chlorogenic acid and asperuloside could be involved in this protective effect.

Such responses include a reduction in plant growth and biomass allocation between shoots and roots, photosynthates partitioning from source to sink organs, the accumulation of carbohydrates, and an induction of several Mg transporters. Some physiological and biochemical parameters are good markers of Mg deficiency stress even though they are not well investigated. In the present study, the halophyte Cakile maritima was subjected to Mg shortage, and several Mg stress indices were analyzed. Our data showed that Mg starvation affected shoot and plant length, leaf number, and plant organ growth. A significant decrease in chlorophyll synthesis and photosynthetic activity was also recorded. Mg deficiency triggered oxidative damage as electrolyte leakage and lipid peroxidation were increased by Mg deficiency while the membrane stability index decreased. For a deeper understanding of the effect of Mg starvation on C. maritima, several tolerance stress indices were evaluated, demonstrating a negative impact of Mg stress on almost all those parameters. This study provided important insights on several markers of Mg deficiency stress, which were informative by themselves as unique and early signals of Mg deficiency stress in this halophyte.</jats:p>",

In addition to its obvious interest as a naturally salt-tolerant plant, this species is mainly cultivated as an ornamental plant in many countries. Laboratory experiments were carried out to assess the effects of salinity on seed germination and on germination recovery from the effects of saline conditions after transfer to distilled water. Seed germination responses were determined at 0, 50, 100, 200 and 300 mM NaCl. Salt (NaCl) does not affect the germination of L. maritima if applied at a moderate dose of 50 mM. For higher concentrations of NaCl, there is a decrease in the germination rate at 100 and 200 mM NaCl or even a total inhibition of germination at 300 mM. Salt lowers or inhibits germination only through osmotic effects. To improve the germination of L. maritima under high salinity, seeds were pretreated with KNO3, thiourea, proline and salicylic acid. The germination of seeds is improved by KNO3 in the presence or absence of salt, while thiourea increases the final germination without affecting the germination rate. Salicylic acid amplifies the effect of salt, while proline delays germination without stopping it completely. These findings indicate that the application of KNO3 and thiourea may be used to improve seed germination of L. maritima, which is of great interest for cultivating this plant for landscaping purposes in saline soils.</jats:p>",

The P combination method and fractions in biochars were characterized, and the effects of biochars on P fractions in different types of alkaline soil were examined with incubation experiments. The results showed that the pH values of P-HBC (3.31) and PA-HBC (2.17) decreased significantly, and the total P content increased to 4.66 g·kg<jats:sup>− 1</jats:sup> and 5.24 g·kg<jats:sup>− 1</jats:sup>, respectively. The spectral analysis confirmed the doping of P and acid groups in biochar. The addition of modified biochars in alkaline soils will makes the soil tend to be neutral. Sequential extraction of soil P confirmed that biochars application facilitated the transformation of stable P into active fractions, with greater effects from modified biochars than HBC. Activation mechanism of biochar to soil P fractions varies from soil types. Overall, acidic phosphorus-rich biochars can be employed to improve alkaline soil properties and increase P activity.</jats:p>"

Therefore, some indices of photosynthetic activity, dry matter production and accumulation of sodium and potassium ions in Blue panicgrass (Panicum antidotale Retz) were evaluated in five levels of salinity treatment (0, 70, 140, 210 and 280 mM NaCl solution) under greenhouse conditions. The results showed that at 28 and 35 days after salt stress, plant leaf area reduced in the highest salinity treatment, 93 and 96% respectively, compared with control. Leaf stomatal conductance, CO2 fixation and quantum efficiency of photosystem II were decreased by increasing salinity. It caused also a reduction in chlorophyll content (Chl a, Chl b) in leaves of Blue panicgrass. Content of carotenoids showed binary patterns to different salinity levels, slightly increased in 70-140 mM NaCl and decreased again in 210-280 mM, respectively. Increasing levels of salinity, increased sodium content in both roots and shoots but the shoots potassium content decreased. Decline in photosynthesis indices caused the reduction of root and shoot dry weight. This decrease resulted from lower leaf area (r=0.91**), lower stomatal conductance (r=0.78**), lower CO2 fixed in photosynthesis (r=0.63**), lower quantum efficiency of photosystem II (r=0.54**) and lower Chl a (r=0.45**), respectively.

We hypothesized that salt treatment in halophytes improves their tolerance against other stressors. To investigate the salt-mediated heavy metal tolerance in halophytes, Lepidium latifolium (Brassicaceae) was cultivated in the absence or presence of salt (100 mM NaCl) and excess Zn (200 μM ZnSO4), alone or in combination, for four weeks in the hydroponic medium. Salt treatment ameliorated the reduction of photosynthetic pigments in Zn-stressed plants and decreased Zn accumulation in the young leaves. The activity of peroxidase increased by both Zn toxicity and salt treatments; its maximum activity was achieved under the combination of both treatments associated with a significant reduction in malondialdehyde concentration. The activity of polyphenol oxidase increased by Zn stress alone or in combination with salt, accompanied by accumulation of free and cell wall-bound phenolics and enhanced lignin deposition in the leaves. Our results showed a mitigating effect of salt treatment in Zn-stressed plants through the activation of antioxidant defense and accumulation of phenolic compounds including flavonoids. Our results suggest L. latifolium as suitable species for revegetation and rehabilitation of saline soils contaminated with heavy metals.</jats:p>",

Similar increases in salinity did not, however, result either in a change in the diurnal pattern of net CO2 assimilation or in an appreciable increase in the fluctuations of titratable acidity. It is suggested that salinity induced the observed shift in δ13C values, not by effecting change in the mode of carboxylation towards that of crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM), but by affecting the degree of limitation of CO2 assimilation by diffusion processes. It is concluded therefore that, in D. clavellatum, CAM is not induced by salinity, as it is in Mesembryanthemum crystallinum.</jats:p>",

Reducing the salt concentration to 1 M KCl induces dimerisation of the protein, which retains its ability to bind DNA. On circular ssDNA, two concentration-dependent binding modes are observed. Conventionally, increased salt concentration adversely affects DNA binding but HvRPA3 does not bind DNA in 0.2 M KCl, although multimerisation may occlude the binding site. The single N-terminal OB-fold is competent to bind DNA in the absence of the C-terminal zinc finger, albeit with reduced affinity.

A large vacuolar reservoir for ion and water storage plays an important role in salinity adaptation. To monitor the acidity of the vacuole at different developmental stages of EBC, peels from the abaxial surface were stained with a pH-sensitive dye, neutral red (NR). Presence of both NR-stained (acidic) and NR-unstained (neutral) EBC were found at the juvenile stage in ice plants. Continuous exposure to illumination decreased the acidity of the NR-stained cells. The EBC protein profile illustrated the prominent co-existence of highly acidic and basic proteins in these specialised cells. Major proteins that accumulate in EBC are involved in photosynthesis, sodium compartmentalisation, and defence. Numerous raphide crystals were found in well fertilised ice plants. Salt-stressed cells exhibited changes in the surface charge and element composition of raphide crystals. A disappearance of potassium in the high-salt grown crystals suggests that these crystals might serve as a potassium reservoir to maintain the Na+/K+ homeostasis in this halophyte.</jats:p>",

In 1992 we noticed the first symptoms of choke disease in a single population of &lt;em&gt;P. distans&lt;/em&gt; in central Poland. Since then we have observed choke disease in 5 populations of &lt;em&gt;P. distans&lt;/em&gt; only in man-made habitats. These habitats are strongly anthropogenically salinated but they exhibit the pattern of species composition characteristic of natural salines. In this paper we test the hypothesis that the level of salinity affects the infection of &lt;em&gt;P. distans&lt;/em&gt; by the fungus &lt;em&gt;E. typhina&lt;/em&gt;. Seven plots were established in the field and each plot was divided into 25 subplots. Within each plot the level of infection in a spring generation of shoots was negatively correlated with salinity (common regression within the plots, beta = -0.674, df = 117, p &amp;lt; 0.001). Negative correlation was also found in an autumn generation within the plots (beta = -0.682, df = 94, p &amp;lt; 0.001) after excluding plot P in which the frequency of infected individuals was the lowest and equal only to 0.05. The proportion of individuals infected by the endophytic stage of the fungus in the populations was assessed using diagnostic polymerase chain reaction. The greatest percentage (98.3%) of infected individuals was found in the population growing in the habitat of the lowest salinity. The high salinity reduces the chance of &lt;em&gt;P. distans&lt;/em&gt; to become infected, but may promote the stroma formation of &lt;em&gt;E. typhina&lt;/em&gt; twice in the season. Disease expression in autumn clearly represents a misadaptation which could be explained by the fact that the species interactions described here appeared relatively recently as a result of human activity. This hypothesis requires further experimental verification.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Kosteletzkya pentacarpos (L.) Ledebour is a perennial facultative halophyte species from the Malvacea family that grows in coastal areas with high amounts of salt. The tolerance of K. pentacarpos to the high concentration of salt (0.5–1.5% salinity range of coastal saline land) has been widely studied for decades. Nowadays, with the dramatic development of the economy and urbanization, in addition to the salt, the accumulation of mate(loid)s in coastal soil is increasing, which is threatening the survival of halophyte species as well as the balance of wetland ecosystems. Recently, the capacity of K. pentacarpos to cope with either single heavy metal stress or a combination of multiple meta(loid) toxicities was studied. Hence, this review focused on summarizing the physiological and biochemical behaviors of K. pentacarpos that has been simultaneously exposed to the combination of several meta(loid) toxicities. How the salt accumulated by K. pentacarpos impacts the response to meta(loid) stress was discussed. We conclude that as a potential candidate for phytoremediation, K. pentacarpos was able to cope with various environmental constrains such as multiple meta(loid) stresses due to its relative tolerance to meta(loid) toxicity.</jats:p>",

Although most conventional crops are non-salt tolerant plants (glycophytes), halophytes can develop under high salinity concentrations and provide food, fodder and other uses, such as remediation and pharmaceuticals. Among them, Suaeda vera can be used for human consumption as forage and in phytoremediation. This study aims to optimize the cultivation of this species by producing a Technosol (TEC) using wastes as amendments to improve the properties of a Fluvisol (FLU). The amendments were constituted by cost-effective wastes: sludge and waste kieselguhr from breweries, medium sand, gravel limestone and biomass obtained from pruning. The FLU used in a microcosm assay was collected in the Tagus Estuary, close to Lisbon, Portugal. The soils properties, plants growth in Fluvisol and Technosol under the estuarine water (Ew) irrigation also collected in Tagus Estuary, were assessed. The microcosm assay was set up with four replicates and the substrata were incubated at 70% of the maximum water-holding capacity for 28 days, in the dark. After, seedlings obtained by germination in wet filter paper with deionised water were transplanted. The amendments, the FLU and the TEC were analysed for: pH, electrical conductivity (EC), concentrations of C&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;organic&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;, P&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;extractable,&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#160;K&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;extractable&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; and N&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;total&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;.

The Ew SAR value was high (157) but tolerated by halophytes. The individuals grown in the TEC presented a larger stem (18 cm) and a higher fresh biomass value (23 g) than individuals grown in the FLU. These results indicate that the wastes improved the Fluvisol properties being S. vera cultivation favoured if carried out in TEC. In a circular economy perspective, this study reveals that it is possible to cultivate a halophyte species with economic potential from underused resources as saline soils, wastes and brackish water.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</jats:p>"

A significant number of changes in metabolites was observed in the halophyte. In terms of alteration of specific metabolic pathways, intercropping conditions stimulated sugar and starch metabolisms in tomato, whereas in the halophyte, intercropping mainly altered amino acid‐related pathways. In addition, arginine and proline metabolism were commonly affected in both tomato and halophyte plants. Moreover, metabolomic changes were associated with physiological alterations in tomato. In this sense, mild oxidative stress was induced in intercropped tomato plants, which, in turn, could trigger signaling events leading to plant adjustment to intercropping conditions. This study represents the first approach toward understanding intercropping interactions at the metabolome level and its effect on plant physiology, opening up prospects for further characterization of this crop cultivation strategy.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> To determine whether or not tolerance limits at the germination stage of development and annual germination patterns affect plant distribution in an inland salt marsh, we assessed germination of dimorphic seeds for Atriplex prostrata Boucher ex DC. and Salicornia europaea L. under field and laboratory conditions. Statistically significant differences were found in germination across marsh zones for both species in the field. However, germination percentages for small seeds of A. prostrata and S. europaea were above 50% and 75%, respectively, across all zones for seeds placed on the surface. For large seeds of each species placed on the surface, germination was above 90% across all zones. Small seeds for both species had primary dormancy, a light requirement for germination, and appeared to exhibit dormancy cycling. Large seeds of A. prostrata were nondormant from December through March, whereas large seeds of S. europaea were nondormant when produced. Persistent seed banks were most likely to be formed from small seeds of both species. Seeds typically germinate in the spring when salinity across the marsh is sufficiently low for seeds to germinate in all zones, indicating that the germination stage of development does not effect the spatial distribution of A. prostrata or S. europaea on the marsh.Key words: Atriplex prostrata, seed dormancy and germination, halophyte, Salicornia europaea, seed dimorphism, salt marsh zonation. </jats:p>",

Halophyte cultivation could constitute an alternative to glycophytic cultures and help resolve these issues. Plantago coronopus can be used in biosaline agriculture as it tolerates salt concentrations of 100 mM NaCl. To increase the salt tolerance of this plant, plant growth regulators such as polyamine spermidine, salicylic acid, gibberellins, cytokinins, and auxins were added in a hydroponic culture before the irrigation of NaCl (200 mM). In 45-day-old plants, dry weight, water content, osmolyte (sorbitol), antioxidants (phenols, flavonoids), polyamines (putrescine, spermidine, spermine (free, bound, and conjugated forms)) and ethylene were determined. In non-saline conditions, all plant regulators improved growth while in plants treated with salt, spermidine application was the most effective in improving growth, osmolyte accumulation (43%) and an increase of antioxidants (24%) in P. coronopus. The pretreatments that increase the sorbitol content, endogenous amines (bound spermine fraction), phenols and flavonoids may be the most effective in protecting to P. coronopus against stress and, therefore, could contribute to improving the tolerance to salinity and increase nutritional quality of P. coronopus.</jats:p>",

The<jats:italic>de novo</jats:italic>assembled transcriptome by Bridger (k-mer 32) was chosen as final assembly for subsequent analysis. In general, 103290 transcripts were obtained. The differential expression analysis (log<jats:sub>2</jats:sub><jats:sup>FC</jats:sup> &gt; 1 and FDR &lt; 0.01) showed that 1861 transcripts expressed differentially, including169 up and 316 down-regulated transcripts in 200 mM NaCl treatment and 1035 up and 430 down-regulated transcripts in 400 mM NaCl treatment compared to control. In addition, 89 transcripts were common in both treatments. The most important over-represented terms in the GO analysis of differentially expressed genes (FDR &lt; 0.05) were chitin response, response to abscisic acid, and regulation of jasmonic acid mediated signaling pathway under 400 mM NaCl treatment and cell cycle, cell division, and mitotic cell cycle process under 200 mM treatment. In addition, the phosphatidylcholine biosynthetic process term was common in both salt treatments. Interestingly, under 400 mM salt treatment, the PRC1 complex that contributes to chromatin remodeling was also enriched along with vacuole as a general salinity stress responsive cell component. Among enriched pathways, the MAPK signaling pathway (ko04016) and phytohormone signal transduction (ko04075) were significantly enriched in 400 mM NaCl treatment, whereas DNA replication (ko03032) was the only pathway that significantly enriched in 200 mM NaCl treatment. Finally, our findings indicate the salt-concentration depended responses of<jats:italic>A. littoralis</jats:italic>, which well-known salinity stress-related pathways are induced in 400 mM NaCl, while less considered pathways, e.g. cell cycle and DNA replication, are highlighted under 200 mM NaCl treatment.</jats:p>",

Quinoa is cultivated in many parts of the world, with a selection of varieties with good adaptability to extreme climatic conditions and salt stress. The variety Red Faro, native to southern Chile but harvested in Tunisia, was considered for salt stress resistance, considering its seed germination and 10-day seedling growth at increasing doses of NaCl (0, 100, 200 and 300 mM). Seedlings were spectrophotometrically analyzed for antioxidant secondary metabolites (polyphenols, flavonoids, flavonols and anthocyanins), antioxidant capacity (ORAC, oxygen radical absorbance capacity, DPPH*, 2,2-diphenyl-1-pic-rylhydrazyl), antioxidant enzyme activity (superoxide dismutase (SOD), guaiacol peroxidase (GPX), ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and catalase (CAT)) and mineral nutrient content in root and shoot tissues. Cytogenetic analysis of root tip was performed to check for meristematic activity and the possible presence of chromosomal abnormalities induced by salt stress. The results indicated a general increase in antioxidant molecules and antioxidant enzymes NaCl dose-dependent, no effects on seed germination but negative effects on seedling growth, and little effect on root meristems mitotic activity.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Seedlings of S. australis were grown hydroponically in nutrient solutions with 0-600 mM NaCl added. The plants grew poorly in the absence of added NaCl and optimal growth, based on fresh or dry weight, occurred at 50-150 mM NaCl. Higher concentrations of NaCl decreased growth although the plants continued to grow even at 600 mM NaCl. The osmotic potential of the leaf sap decreased with increasing salinity and this was mostly the result of accumulation of NaCl in the leaves. Leaf K+ concentration decreased with increasing salinity while both Na+ and Cl- increased, reaching 800 and 500 mM, respectively, on a tissue water basis. Intact chloroplasts were isolated by mechanically disrupting the leaves and the chloroplasts were purified on a two-step Percoll gradient. The osmotic potential of the isolation medium was adjusted so as to be isotonic with the leaf sap in each case. The chloroplasts were generally more than 90% intact and exhibited rates of CO2-dependent oxygen evolution of 70-130 µmol (mg chlorophyll) -1 h-1. The concentration of K+ in the chloroplast decreased with increasing salinity and was similar to the concentration of K+ in the leaf as a whole. For plants grown without added NaCI, leaf Na+ and Cl- concentrations were low (less than 10 mM) but these ions were accumulated in the chloroplasts, which contained 70-140 mM Na+ and 80-120 mM Cl-. With increasing salinity, the concentration of Na+ and Cl- in the chloroplast did not increase despite the more than 70-fold increase in the concentration of these two ions in the leaf. The results suggest that the concentration of Na+ and Cl- in the chloroplasts of Suaeda australis is regulated, with these ions being accumulated in the chloroplast at low leaf levels and excluded from the chloroplast when leaf Na+ and Cl- are high.</jats:p>",

To obtain insights into the physiology of this novel group of organisms, a draft genome sequence of the Seminole strain was obtained. A cluster of 13 genes predicted to be functional in the hydrocarbon degradation pathway was identified from the sequence. Two-dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry were used to corroborate the role of the predicted open reading frames (ORFs). ORFs 1080 and 1082 were identified as components of a multicomponent phenol hydroxylase complex, and ORF 1086 was identified as catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (2,3-CAT). Based on this analysis, it was hypothesized that benzene is converted to phenol and then to catechol by phenol hydroxylase components. The resulting catechol undergoes ring cleavage via the meta pathway by 2,3-CAT to form 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde, which enters the tricarboxylic acid cycle. To substantiate these findings, the Rozel strain was grown on deuterated benzene, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry detected deuterated phenol as the initial intermediate of benzene degradation. These studies establish the initial steps of the benzene degradation pathway in halophiles.\n          </jats:p>",

Plants were cultivated in the presence of increasing concentrations of Al and As alone (200, 500 and 800 µM), or mixed with NaCl (200 mM). The results revealed that both metals altered the growth and development of <jats:italic>T.gallica</jats:italic>. Finding showed that the metals’ accumulation was dependent on the concentrations of the metals in the medium. Interestingly, while salt reduced As uptake, an augmentation in Al accumulation was observed. In addition, <jats:italic>T. gallica</jats:italic> demonstrated that APX was the predominant enzyme to scavenge excess ROS. However, SOD and GPX were sensitive to the metal, showing different behaviour in metal stress alone or combined with salt. Proline accumulated in a dose-dependent manner under Al and As stress, rather than lower or unchanged levels of glycine betaine. We also noticed a diminution in proline content caused by NaCl application while an increase in glycine betaine was remarked. On the other hand, the combined stress enhanced proline whereas unchanged levels of glycine betaine were observed. Finally, <jats:italic>T. gallica</jats:italic> demonstrated its potential to grow under elevated concentrations of As/Al and could be considered a suitable candidate for phytostabilization/ phytoremediation approach.</jats:p>"

Spinach is traditionally classified as a glycophyte but our previous and current results strongly suggest otherwise. In this study, we compared two quinoa with two spinach cultivars grown under low (2 dS m⁻¹) and high (25 dS m⁻¹) irrigation-water salinities. Using Scanning Electron Microscopy coupled with Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), we demonstrated that spinach has EBCs that accumulate mostly Cl, followed by K, and to a lesser extent Na, while quinoa EBCs showed no detectable Na signal. Morphologically, quinoa EBCs have single-celled stalks while spinach EBCs have multicellular stalks; both feature globular heads approximately 150 µm in diameter. Spinach displayed higher expression of Na- and Cl-transporter genes in EBCs than in EBC-free leaf tissue. Under identical salinity levels (2-24 dS m⁻¹), both spinach and quinoa exhibited comparable reductions in biomass and plant height. Despite higher Na and Cl accumulation, spinach exhibited no visible signs of salt toxicity. The presence of EBCs and apparent tissue-level salt tolerance provide new insights into spinach anatomy and ion partitioning under salinity stress, suggesting that spinach may be more accurately classified as a facultative halophyte.</jats:p>",

Efficient phytoextraction requires high-biomass plants with efficient translocating properties. Halophytes characteristically accumulate large quantities of salts in aboveground tissue material and can have high biomass production. It has been speculated that salt-tolerant plants may also be heavy metal tolerant and, further, may be able to accumulate metals. This study compared growth and metal uptake by a halophyte, Atriplex nummularia, and a common glycophyte, Zea mays, in a minetailing contaminated soil:mulch mixture. Two chelators, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and rhamnolipid, were used to facilitate plant metal uptake. Despite a lower growth rate (2% growth/d) in the contaminated soil, the halophyte accumulated roughly the same amount of metals as the glycophyte on a mass basis (30–40 mg/kg dry wt). Neither plant, however, hyperaccumulated any of the metals tested. When treated with EDTA, specific differences in patterns of metal uptake between the two plants emerged. The halophyte accumulated significantly more Cu (2X) and Pb (1X) in the shoots than the glycophyte, but root metal concentrations were generally higher for the glycophyte, indicating that the halophyte translocated more metal from the root to the shoot than the glycophyte. For example, Zn shoot-to-root ratios ranged from 1.4 to 2.1 for Atriplex and from 0.5 to 0.6 for Z. mays. The biodegradable chelator rhamnolipid was not effective at enhancing shoot metal concentrations, even though radiolabeled chelator was found in the shoot material of both plants. Our results suggest that halophytes, despite their slower growth rates, may have greater potential to selectively phytoextract metals from contaminated soils than glycophytes.</jats:p>",

It thrives in sandy and saline environments, making it highly resistant to abiotic stresses like salinity and drought. This plant can be used for the restoration of salt-contaminated soils due to its ability to tolerate high sodium (Na) concentrations. Even under extreme salinity, it continues to grow without visible damage. The plant also produces a variety of bioactive compounds, including 20 hydroxyecdysone, secondary metabolites and antibacterial compounds. It is also rich in essential nutrients, making it valuable for application in food, medicine, natural fertilizers and animal feed. Studies in its biochemistry, molecular biology and physiology hasprovided insights into the mechanisms underlying its abiotic stress tolerance. Furthermore, biotechnological studies suggest its potential for pharmaceutical application. In dry and semiarid regions, the large-scale cultivation of S. portulacastrum contributes to the remediation of soils by reducing heavy metal concentration and salt concentrations in soils. For instance, in experiment where Na was added to soil, it led to a decrease in electrical conductivity and Na content, with 77.8 % of the Na extracted over a period of ninety days. Due to its resilience under saline, drought-prone and heavy metal-stressed conditions, this species serves as an effective bio indicator for pollution detection and a predictive tool for forecasting soil salinity.</jats:p>",

Its adaptability to survive saline stress has been proven with eco-physiological and biochemical studies. However, little is known about its molecular mechanisms of salt tolerance. In this study, an integrated transcriptome and proteome analysis approach, based on RNA sequencing and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), was used to identify the said mechanisms. Plants were treated with control (0 mM), low (100 mM), and high (300 mM) sodium chloride (NaCl) treatments to distinguish beneficial and toxic pathways influencing plant biomass. The results indicated differential expression of 3,179 (1,126 upregulated/2,053 downregulated) and 2,172 (898 upregulated/1,274 downregulated) genes (DEGs), and 514 (269 upregulated/245 downregulated) and 836 (494 upregulated/392 downregulated) proteins (DEPs) at 100 and 300 mM NaCl, respectively. Among these, most upregulated genes and proteins were involved in salt resistance strategies such as proline biosynthesis, the antioxidant defense system, ion homeostasis, and sugar accumulation at low salinity levels. On the other hand, the expression of several genes and proteins involved in the respiratory process were downregulated, indicating the inability of plants to meet their energy demands at high salinity levels. Moreover, the impairments in photosynthesis were also evident with the reduced expression of genes regulating the structure of photosystems and increased expression of abscisic acid (ABA) mediated pathways which limits stomatal gas exchange. Similarly, the disturbance in fatty acid metabolism and activation of essential ion transport blockers damaged the integrity of the cell membrane, which was also evident with enhanced malondialdehyde (MDA). Overall, the analysis of pathways revealed that the plant optimal performance at low salinity was related to enhanced metabolism, antioxidative defense, cell growth, and signaling pathways, whereas high salinity inhibited biomass accumulation by altered expression of numerous genes involved in carbon metabolism, signaling, transcription, and translation. The data provided the first global analysis of the mechanisms imparting salt stress tolerance of any halophyte at transcriptome and proteome levels.</jats:p>",

The species has potential uses for saline agriculture and biofuel production, but the effects of salt stress on its nutrition and physiology remain unclear. Plants of S. fruticosa were grown in pots with a mixture of sphagnum peat-moss and Perlite. In order to evaluate the effects of different levels of salinity, five treatments using different NaCl concentrations (10 (control), 60, 100, 200 and 300 mM NaCl) were applied over a period of 60 days. At the end of the experiment, the dry weight, the biomass allocation and the tissue water content were measured for each salinity treatment. The net uptake of various nutrients and their translocation rates were calculated for each salt treatment. Salt loss, shedding of plant parts and succulence in shoots were evaluated together with the K+/Na+ ratio, K-Na selectivity, concentrations of osmolytes and their estimated contributions to the osmotic potential. Our results showed that S. fruticosa can maintain its major physiological processes at 60 mM NaCl without significant dry weight reduction. Higher salinity resulted in negative values for net uptake and translocation rates from roots to shoots of N and P. As might be predicted from other dicotyledonous halophytes, S. fruticosa plants increased Cl– and Na+ uptake using both as osmotica instead of organic osmolytes. However, to survive salinity, this species has also evolved others mechanisms such as shedding old shoots, increased succulence in shoots at higher salt concentrations and the ability to maintain a lower K+/Na+ ratio and higher K-Na selectivity in all organs.</jats:p>",

Roots are the primary structure that first senses the negative effects of salt stress. So, roots were selected to study the tolerance mechanism.

Higher reduction in protein content was observed under sodicity stress than salinity stress. In control roots, a total of 26 polypeptide bands were expressed ranging from 12.43 kDa to 81.3 kDa. Under high salinity stress, number of polypeptide bands increased to 31 at ECe ~ 50 dS/m that might be responsible for their survival and growth while sodic stress led to disappearance of more number of polypeptides with a total number of 23 polypeptides at pH ~ 10.0.

The interaction between salinity and heavy metal stress was analyzed in relation to plant growth, tissue ion contents (Na+, K+ and Mg2+), oxidative damage and antioxidative metabolism. Data indicate that shoot and root weight significantly decreased as a consequence of Cd2+- or Cu2+-induced stress. Metallic stress leads to unbalanced nutrient uptake by reducing the translocation of K+ and Mg2+ from the root to the shoot. The levels of malondialdehyde increased in root tissue when Cd, and especially Cu, were added to the irrigation solution, indicating that oxidative damage occurred. Results showed that NaCl gave a partial protection against Cd and Cu induced toxicity, although these contaminants had distinct influence on plant physiology. It can be concluded that salinity drastically modified heavy metal absorption and improved plant growth.

Sequential membrane filtration and acid hydrolysis indicated the polyphenols forming complexes with other compounds, retaining the polyphenols in the retentate fraction of large molecular weight cut-off membrane sizes. Conventional liquid–liquid extraction using sequential ethyl acetate and n-butanol showed most polyphenols were extracted, apart from chlorogenic acids, indicating a low isolation efficiency of higher polarity polyphenols. Analysis of the extract after resin adsorption by Amberlite XAD-4 resin showed high efficiency for separation, with 100% of polyphenols adsorbed to the resin after 13 bed volumes and 96.7% eluted from the resin using ethanol. CPC fractionations were performed to fractionate the concentrated extract after resin adsorption.

Using these easily scalable methods, it was possible to comprehensively study the polyphenols of interest from S. ramosissima and their isolation mechanics. This study will potentially lead the way for the large-scale isolation of polyphenols from S. ramosissima and other complex halophytes. The compounds of the highest concentration after CPC fractionation were isoquercitrin and hyperoside (155.27 mg/g), chlorogenic acid (85.54 mg/g), cryptochlorogenic acid (101.50 mg/g), and protocatechuic acid (398.67 mg/g), and further isolation using CPC could potentially yield novel polyphenol nutraceuticals.</jats:p>",

Thus, the seeds of J. ranarius have physiological dormancy, e.g. they are water permeable, have a fully developed embryo and require cold stratification to come out of dormancy. Furthermore, promotion of germination by GA3 after-ripening in dry storage also indicated that these seeds have non-deep physiological dormancy. In general, the higher the GA3 concentration, the more germination occurred within the studied range. Juncus ranarius demonstrated a germination preference for light. The highest germination percentage and rate of germination were recorded under constant light conditions at 22 Â°C after 24 weeks of cold stratification. In saline solutions, the highest percentage of germination was obtained at 25 mM L-1  NaCl, and further increase in salinity resulted in a gradual decrease in germination. However, ungerminated seeds were not damaged by salt, showing a high level of recovery. The greater the reduction in salinity, the better the germination rate became.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Climate change, expanding soil salinization, and the developing shortages of freshwater have negatively affected crop production around the world. Seawater and salinized lands represent potentially cultivable areas for edible salt-tolerant plants. In the present study, the effect of salinity stress on plant growth, mineral composition (macro-and micro-nutrients), and antioxidant activity in dune spinach (Tetragonia decumbens) were evaluated. The treatments consisted of three salt concentrations, 50, 100, and 200 mM, produced by adding NaCl to the nutrient solution. The control treatment had no NaCl but was sustained and irrigated by the nutrient solution. Results revealed a significant increase in total yield, branch production, and ferric reducing antioxidant power in plants irrigated with nutrient solution incorporated with 50 mM NaCl. Conversely, an increased level of salinity (200 mM) caused a decrease in chlorophyll content (SPAD), while the phenolic content, as well as nitrogen, phosphorus, and sodium, increased. The results of this study indicate that there is potential for brackish water cultivation of dune spinach for consumption, especially in provinces experiencing the adverse effect of drought and salinity, where seawater or underground saline water could be diluted and used as irrigation water in the production of this vegetable.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In their natural biotope, plants are challenged with low nutrient availability which is one of the most important limiting factors for plant production. Nutrient limitation causes disruption in several metabolic pathways resulting in a decrease in plant growth and establishment. Such responses were mostly studied in glycophytes while in halophytes the data remained scare. In the present investigation, using Cakile maritima as a plant model for halophytes, we attempt to elucidate the behavior of this species under critical magnesium and potassium thresholds. Our data showed that low K or Mg supply (0.01 mM) reduced leaf number and biomass production in leaves, stems and roots while both parameters were improved at 0.05 mM Mg and K concentration before reaching an optimum at 0.25 mM Mg and 1 mM K, respectively. Several indices of K and Mg stress tolerance were reduced upon deficiency in both elements and were significantly improved by moderate K and Mg supply. Photosynthetic pigment content was reduced upon both deficiencies with the highest reductions recorded in plants suffering from severe Mg and K starvation. Increasing Mg and K supply resulted in better chlorophyll synthesis as reflected by the increase in chlorophyll stability index parameter (CSI). Furthermore, both deficiencies triggered oxidative damages as malondialdehyde content (MDA) and electrolyte leakage (EL) increased while membrane stability index (MSI) decreased under both deficiencies. Such results suggested that the cell redox homeostasis was altered when Mg and K were omitted from the nutrient solution. Interestingly, moderate and high Mg and K concentrations promoted C. maritima growth and reduced the oxidative damage caused by the lack of both elements in the external medium. Overall, C. maritima exhibited a typical halophytic behaviour, requiring less macroelements to express its growth performance when cultivated under critical magnesium and potassium thresholds.</jats:p>",

However, it did not suppress the salt-sensitive phenotype of the yeast strain G19 (?ena1–4), which lacks a major component of Na+ efflux. Transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. plants overexpressing SsHKT1;1 showed enhanced salt tolerance and increased shoot K+ concentration, whereas no significant changes in shoot Na+ concentration were observed. S. salsa was also used to investigate K+ uptake properties under salinity. The K+ transporters in the roots selectively mediated K+ uptake irrespective of external Na+ and their inhibitor did not affect Na+ uptake at low K+. Thus, both molecular and physiological studies provide strong in vivo evidence that SsHKT1;1 mainly acts as a potassium transporter in heterologous expression systems and S. salsa, and that it is involved in salt tolerance by taking part in the maintenance of cytosolic cation homeostasis, particularly, in the maintenance of K+ nutrition under salinity.</jats:p>",

We investigated leaf water relations and hydraulics, gas exchange, nitrogen and starch content in two populations of S. patens growing under contrasting salinity levels in a salt marsh and in a dune system in order to assess its functional plasticity as a factor contributing to its invasive potential. The analysis of leaf water relations revealed a suite of mechanisms adopted by S. patens to overcome salt and drought stress while maintaining relatively invariant leaf morphological traits and plant biomass. In particular, salt marsh plants experiencing severe water stress underwent greater osmoregulation and leaf hydraulic adjustment than dune plants. We also present the first experimental evidence for salt-mediated regulation of xylem hydraulic efficiency in a halophytic grass and suggest that it is an important functional trait allowing plants growing in saline habitats to cope with a restricted water supply. The functional plasticity of leaf water relations and xylem hydraulics emerges as a key trait underlying the competitive ability and invasive potential of S. patens.</jats:p>",

To investigate the effects of different salts on the seed germination and radicle survival of this halophytic shrub, seeds were incubated in various salt (NaCl, Na2SO4, MgCl2, or MgSO4 with or without CaCl2) or polyethylene glycol-6000 solutions. The germination percentage and the percentage of emerging radicles surviving to a length of at least 4 mm were examined. The survival of K. caspicum radicles depended mainly on the cation composition of the media: both Na+ and Mg2+ had toxic effects on the radicles, while Ca2+ alleviated the toxicity of these cations. Mg2+ was more toxic than Na+ and a higher concentration of Ca2+ was needed to alleviate its toxicity. It was suggested that the establishment of seedlings of K. caspicum in the field is facilitated by the marked alleviation of salt toxicity by Ca2+ and that the proportion of soluble Na, Mg and Ca ions in the soil determines the distribution of K. caspicum in the field.</jats:p>",

Lycium ruthenicum Murr., a shrub with significant soil and water conservation capacities. In this paper, we analyze the trade-offs of leaf functional traits of eight L.ruthenicum populations growing at varying distances from the Heihe river by dividing the eight sites into three groups according to the average soil salinity and discussing the effects of soil factors at 0-40cm and 40-80cm on leaf trait patterns. We also attempt to explain desert L.ruthenicum trade-off strategies by choosing fourteen leaf traits to link with soil factors. Results: Low N contents indicated that L.ruthenicum was located at the slow investment-return axis of the species resource utilization graph. Compared to non-saline and very slightly saline sites, populations of slightly saline sites showed higher C:N. The redundancy analysis \"RDA\" results showed that 0-40cm and 40-80cm soil properties explained 70.99% and 71.09% of leaf trait variation, respectively. As soil salinity gradients increased, leaf C:N increased and N content decreased, and the difference was significant. Populations in non-saline and very slightly saline habitats tended to have higher leaf C content, while populations in slightly saline habitats tended to have lower leaf C content, and the discrepancy was evident. Relative importance analysis found that in the 0-40cm layer, leaf traits variations were mainly influenced by soil water content (SWC), HCO3-and CO32-, while leaf trait variations in the 40-80cm layer were mainly influenced by HCO3- and SO42-ions. Conclusions: The growth of L. ruthenicum in the Ejina desert is mainly restricted by N content, which determines soil fertility. L.ruthenicum has a foliar resource acquisition method and a resource conservation trade-off with a flexible life history strategy. Leaf traits can vary significantly due to different environments in a given habitat. As the environmental gradient changes from mild to severe, the populations present a pattern of increased C:N,increased C content, reduced N:P, and reduced N content. In the shallow soil layers of saline-stressed arid environments,water has a greater effect than salt on leaf trait variation.In both shallow and deep soil layers, HCO3- ions have a relatively large effect on leaf properties.</jats:p>"

To investigate this species’ ability to cope with recurrent drought and salt stress, one-year-old plants were subjected to two salt stress treatments (watering with 0.5 and 1 M NaCl solutions), one water stress treatment (complete irrigation withholding), or watered with non-saline water for the control, across three phases: first stress (30 days), recovery from both stresses (15 days), and second stress (15 days). Growth and biochemical parameters were determined after each period. The plants showed high salt tolerance but were sensitive to water deficit, as shown by the decrease in leaf fresh weight and water content, root water content, and photosynthetic pigments levels in response to the first water stress; then, they were restored to the respective control values upon recovery. Salt tolerance was partly based on the accumulation of Na+, Cl− and Ca2+ in the roots and predominantly in the leaves; ion levels also decreased to control values during recovery. Organic osmolytes (proline and total soluble sugars), oxidative stress markers (malondialdehyde and H2O2), and antioxidant compounds (total phenolic compounds and flavonoids) increased by various degrees under the first salt and water stress treatments, and declined after recovery. The analysed variables increased again, but generally to a lesser extent, during the second stress phase, suggesting the occurrence of stress acclimation acquired by the activation of defence mechanisms during the first stress period.</jats:p>",

To foster the valorization of halophytes produced using an IMTA framework for human consumption, it is important that culture conditions keep or enhance their FA profile, when compared to that displayed by conspecifics in the wild. The main objective of the present study was to compare the FA profiles of three halophyte species (Halimione portulacoides, Salicornia ramosissima and Sarcocornia perennis) cultured in aquaponics coupled to an IMTA system with that of wild conspecifics retrieved from donor sites. The FA profiles were compared considering different plant organs (edible parts and roots) and sampling dates (spring, summer and autumn). Results show that the FA profiles of specimens cultured in aquaponics were significantly different from that of wild conspecifics, displaying a high content of omega-3 FAs in edible parts, particularly during summer, and mostly in the form of α-linolenic acid (ALA, 18:3n-3). In more detail, for the specimens cultured in aquaponics, ALA concentration in the edible parts of each species ranged from 5.10 to 7.11 μg mg−1 DW in H. portulacoides, from 5.66 to 9.19 μg mg−1 DW in S. ramosissima and from 5.49 to 7.20 μg mg−1 DW in S. perennis. Concerning the omega-6 linoleic acid (LA, 18:2n-6) identified in edible parts, the concentrations ranged from 2.25 to 2.46 μg mg−1 DW in H. portulacoides, from 3.26 to 4.84 μg mg−1 DW in S. ramosissima, and from 2.17 to 3.06 μg mg−1 DW in S. perennis. The nutritional quality was assessed through the ratio of PUFA/SFA, for both wild and cultured plants, and revealed values well above the threshold (0.45), the threshold value indicative of good nutritional quality. Overall, the culture conditions tested in the present work reinforce the potential of aquaponics coupled to marine IMTA to produce high-quality halophytes suitable for human consumption.</jats:p>",

Humic substances, indicators of soil fertility, are dominant in soil organic matter. However, soil degradation has been occurring all over the world, usually by soil salinization. Sustainable soil productivity has become an urgent problem to be solved. In this study, fluorescence excitation-emission matrices integrated with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) and canonical correlation analysis (CCA) were applied to characterize the components of fulvic acid (FA) and humic acid (HA) substances extracted from soils from the Liaohe River Delta, China. Along the saline gradient, soil samples with four disparate depths were gathered from four aboriginal halophyte communities, i.e., the Suaeda salsa Community (SSC), Chenopodium album Community (CAC), Phragmites australis Community (PAC), and Artemisia selengensis Community (ASC). Six components (C1 to C6) were identified in the FA and HA substances. The FA dominant fractions accounted for an average of 45.81% of the samples, whereas the HA dominant fractions accounted for an average of 42.72%. Mature levels of the HA fractions were higher than those of the FA fractions, so was the condensation degree, microbial activity, and humification degree of the FA fractions. C1 was associated with the ultraviolet FA, C2 was referred to as visible FA, C3 and C4 were relative to ultraviolet HA, C5 represented microbial humic-like substances (MH), and C6 referred to visible HA. C1, C2, C5 and C6 were latent factors of the FA fractions, determined using the CCA method and could possibly be used to differentiate among the SSC, CAC, PAC and ASC samples. C3, C4, C6 and C5 were latent factors of the HA fractions, which might be able to distinguish the ASC samples from the SSC, CAC and PAC samples. Fluorescence spectroscopy combined with the PARAFAC and CCA is a practical technique that is applied to assess the humic substance content of salinized soils.</jats:p>",

Phosphatidyl glycerol content markedly increased, whereas that of phosphatidyl ethanolamine decreased, with increasing salt concentration (0.5 to 3 M NaCl) in the growth medium. These changes result in an increase in the mole ratio of negatively charged polar lipids to neutral polar lipids.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The phytoextraction potential of halophytes has been broadly recognized. Nevertheless, the impact of salt on the accumulation proprieties of cadmium (Cd) in different halophytic species, likely linked to their salt tolerance, remains unclear. A hydroponic culture was used to investigate the impact of salinity on Cd tolerance as well as accumulation in the distinct halophyte Salicornia fruticosa (S. fruticosa). The plant was subjected to 0, 25, and 50 μg L−1 Cd (0-Cd, L-Cd, and H-Cd, respectively), with or without 50, 100, and 200 mM NaCl in the nutrient solution. Data demonstrated that Cd individually induced depletion in biomass accumulation. NaCl amplified the Cd tolerance induced by enhanced biomass gaining and root length, which was associated with adequate transpiration, leaf succulence, elevated levels of ascorbic acid (ASA), reduced glutathione (GSH), phytochelatins (PCs), and proline as well as antioxidant enzymatic capacity via upregulation of peroxidases (PO), glutathione peroxidase, ascorbate peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase. All Cd treatments decreased the uptake of calcium (Ca) as well as potassium (K) and transport to the shoots; however, sodium (Na) accumulation in the shoots was not influenced by Cd. Consequently, S. fruticosa retained its halophytic properties. Based on the low transfer efficiency and high enrichment coefficient at 0–50 mM NaCl, an examination of Cd accumulation characteristics revealed that phytostabilization was the selected phytoremediation strategy. At 100–200 mM NaCl, the high aboveground Cd-translocation and high absorption efficiency encourage phytoremediation via phytoextraction. The results revealed that S. fruticosa might be also potentially utilized to renovate saline soils tainted with heavy metals (HMs) because of its maximized capacity for Cd tolerance magnified by NaCl. Cd accumulation in S. fruticosa is mainly depending on the NaCl concentration. Future studies may be established for other heavy metal pollutants screening, to detect which could be extracted and/or stabilized by the S. fruticosa plant; moreover, other substrates presenting high electrical conductivity should be identified for reclamation.</jats:p>",

The salinity is shaped under the most important climatic states because due to reduced molecular activity of water causes increase in water vaporization. For most of the important crops, mean yield is only a fraction, somewhere between 20% and 50% of listed yield; mostly all this waste is due to lack of rain and salinity rich soil, climatic states which will aggravate in most area as the consequence of worldwide environmental change. In addition to this, salt-effected soil is adjacent to the territories in which the salinity is produced by the low quality of the waterlog method of moisten. The physiological and metabolic developments in plants are stimulated by the saline soil but growth is affected by it. As a result of the saltiness, plants hold against, ovule growth, life span, yield, and its divisions. The salt stress is helpful in decreasing the photosynthesis and rate of respiration of plants. The substance of some optional pants is essentially rich in plants grow beneath salt stress than in those grow under normal condition.

The Suaeda salsa seedlings were exposed to seven salt treatments of different concentrations (0 mmol/L (control), 50 mmol/L, 100 mmol/L, 200 mmol/L, 300 mmol/L, 400 mmol/L, and 600 mmol/L) in natural conditions. The physiological indicators of plant height, fresh weight, dry weight, leaf succulence, chlorophyll content, and carotenoid content were measured, in addition to the reflectance spectra of Suaeda salsa at both the canopy and leaf level. Firstly, the effects of salt stress on the physiological indicators and reflectance spectra were analyzed by the qualitative and quantitative methods. Then, physiological indicators sensitive to salt stress were further retrieved. Afterwards hyperspectral indices such as a/b and ((a-b)/(a+b) ) sensitive to salt stress were also extracted by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Student-Newman-Keuls (S-N-K) comparison test. Our results showed that plant height, root length, leaf succulence, biomass, Chl-a, and Chl-b were sensitive to salt stress, while carotenoids (Car) and relative water content on the root were not significantly affected by salt stress. At the salt concentration of 200 mmol/L, plant height, biomass, relative water content, leaf succulence peaked. With enhanced salt stress, physiological indicators decreased. The first-order derivative spectral reflectance has the highest correlation with salt stress, compared to the control. The spectral index most sensitive to the salt stress at the canopy level is (D903&amp;minus;D851)/(D903+D851), for which the multiple determination coefficient (r2) is 0.9216. While the most sensitive spectral index to the salt stress is (D442&amp;minus;D667)/(D442+D667) at the leaf level, for which the r2 is &amp;minus;0.898. In summary, the results indicated that there exists the quantitative relationship between the physiological indicators and spectra reflectance under salt stress and hyperspectral plant indices can effectively estimate the degree of salt stress. The inconsistency between the diagnostic hyperspectral plant indices at the canopy and leaf levels may be caused by the observation conditions, canopy structure.</jats:p>"

H was better adapted to drought stress than C. Net photosynthetic rate (PN) was mainly related to soil water status in the main root system activity layer. In July, the daily variations of PN and transpiration (Tr) for C were higher than H. C increased water use efficiency (WUE) with increases in PN, while H decreased Tr to obtain a higher WUE. Either C or H, drought reduced the low light and metabolic capacity, and thus decreased the light adaptability and photosynthesis potential.

In Salicornia the tissue OP decrease was concurrent with an increase in the CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> uptake, whereas the CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> uptake of Distichlis declined with decreasing OP of the medium despite a decrease in its tissue OP. It is concluded that Salicornia requires NaCl for its normal development, whereas Distichlis is adversely affected by it. Both species however, are better adapted to osmotic stress due to natural osmotic agents like NaCl, than to the osmotic stress due to artificial osmotic agents like ethylene glycol.</jats:p>",

Removal of Ca2+ from the culture medium stimulated callus growth and the calluses could be sub-cultured without CaCl2 (low-Ca callus line). The intra- (cytoplasmic matrix and vacuole) and extra- (cell wall) cellular concentrations of elements, i.e., [Ca], [K], [Cl], [Na], [Mg], [P] and [S] were investigated using quantitative X-ray microanalysis of cryosections of calluses from bothcell lines. [Ca] was high in the cytoplasmic matrix and cell wall of the high-Ca line. [Ca] was lowered in the low-Calineinall cell compartments, though still detected. Ca-containing electron-dense precipitates were accumulated in the middle lamella of cell walls in resin-embedded sections of the high-Ca line. CaCl2 in the medium stimulated protoplast growth only in the low-Caline. These results suggested that a low cellular [Ca] is needed for protoplasts growth of A. alba. The importance of cellular [Ca] for the growth of halophilic mangrove plant cells was discussed.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Halophyte species implement a “salt-including” strategy, sequestering significant amounts of Na+ to cell vacuoles. This requires a reduction of passive Na+ leak from the vacuole. In this work, we used quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa) to investigate the ability of halophytes to regulate Na+-permeable slow-activating (SV) and fast-activating (FV) tonoplast channels, linking it with Na+ accumulation in mesophyll cells and salt bladders as well as leaf photosynthetic efficiency under salt stress. Our data indicate that young leaves rely on Na+ exclusion to salt bladders, whereas old ones, possessing far fewer salt bladders, depend almost exclusively on Na+ sequestration to mesophyll vacuoles. Moreover, although old leaves accumulate more Na+, this does not compromise their leaf photochemistry. FV and SV channels are slightly more permeable for K+ than for Na+, and vacuoles in young leaves express less FV current and with a density unchanged in plants subjected to high (400 mm NaCl) salinity. In old leaves, with an intrinsically lower density of the FV current, FV channel density decreases about 2-fold in plants grown under high salinity. In contrast, intrinsic activity of SV channels in vacuoles from young leaves is unchanged under salt stress. In vacuoles of old leaves, however, it is 2- and 7-fold lower in older compared with young leaves in control- and salt-grown plants, respectively. We conclude that the negative control of SV and FV tonoplast channel activity in old leaves reduces Na+ leak, thus enabling efficient sequestration of Na+ to their vacuoles. This enables optimal photosynthetic performance, conferring salinity tolerance in quinoa species.</jats:p>",

At moderate salinity (10 dS/m sodium chloride NaCl), plant growth and photosynthetic activity were enhanced, whereas high salinity (20 dS/m) led to significant reductions in biomass, photosynthetic efficiency, and water use efficiency. Salinity-induced oxidative stress was confirmed by elevated levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), in upper plant tissues. Foliar application of two bioactive compounds—Aquamin and Cultisano—partially mitigated the detrimental effects of high salinity. Treated plants maintained higher photosynthetic parameters and exhibited improved antioxidant profile compared to untreated controls. Furthermore, GC–MS analysis of essential oils revealed that salinity altered the composition of key volatile components, notably increasing γ-terpinene and reducing p-cymene content. Biostimulant treatments counteracted these changes, enhancing terpene components such as p-cymene, and thymol-methyl-ether. Overall, the findings highlight the potential of biostimulants to enhance both salt tolerance as well as the phytochemical value of C. maritimum, suggesting promising applications in sustainable agriculture and high-value plant product development under saline conditions. It was concluded that the type of biostimulant significantly influenced the physiological and quality characteristics of sea fennel plants.

This study focused on the genomic evolution of <jats:italic>Laburnicola rhizohalophila</jats:italic>, a dark-septate endophytic fungus from roots of a halophyte. Chromosome-level assemblies were generated from five representative isolates from structured subpopulations. The data revealed significant genomic plasticity resulting from chromosomal polymorphisms created by fusion and fission events, known as dysploidy. Analyses of genomic features, phylogenomics, and macrosynteny have provided clear evidence for the origin of intraspecific diploid-like hybrids. Notably, one diploid phenotype stood out as an outlier and exhibited a conditional fitness advantage when exposed to a range of abiotic stresses compared with its parents. By comparing the gene expression patterns in each hybrid parent triad under the four growth conditions, the mechanisms underlying growth vigor were corroborated through an analysis of transgressively upregulated genes enriched in membrane glycerolipid biosynthesis and transmembrane transporter activity. In vitro assays suggested increased membrane integrity and lipid accumulation, as well as decreased malondialdehyde production under optimal salt conditions (0.3 M NaCl) in the hybrid. These attributes have been implicated in salinity tolerance. This study supports the notion that hybridization-induced genome doubling leads to the emergence of phenotypic innovations in an extremophilic endophyte.</jats:p>",

In salt tolerant plant Zoysia macrostachya, germination, physiology, and genetic variation under salinity have been studied previously, and the morphology and distribution of salt glands have been clarified. However, no study has investigated the transcriptome of such species under salt stress. In the present study, we compared transcriptome of Z. macrostachya under normal conditions and salt stress (300 mmol/L NaCl, 24 h) aimed to identify transcriptome responses and molecular mechanisms under salt stress in Z. macrostachya. A total of 8703 differently expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, including 4903 up-regulated and 3800 down-regulated ones. Moreover, a series of molecular processes were identified by Gene Ontology (GO) analysis, and these processes were suggested to be closely related to salt tolerance in Z. macrostachya. The identified DEGs concentrated on regulating plant growth via plant hormone signal transduction, maintaining ion homeostasis via salt secretion and osmoregulatory substance accumulation and preventing oxidative damage via increasing the activity of ROS (reactive oxygen species) scavenging system. These changes may be the most important responses of Z. macrostachya under salt stress. Some key genes related to salt stress were identified meanwhile. Collectively, our findings provided valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms and genetic underpinnings of salt tolerance in Z. macrostachya.</jats:p>",

Heterolobosea encompasses more than 150 described species, many of them from extreme habitats, but only six heterolobosean mitogenomes have been fully sequenced to date. Here we complete the mitogenome of the heterolobosean Pleurostomum flabellatum, which is extremely halophilic and reportedly also lacks classical mitochondrial cristae, hinting at reduction or loss of respiratory function. The mitogenome of P. flabellatum maps as a 57,829-bp-long circular molecule, including 40 coding sequences (19 tRNA, two rRNA, and 19 orfs). The gene content and gene arrangement are similar to Naegleria gruberi and Naegleria fowleri, the closest relatives with sequenced mitogenomes. The P. flabellatum mitogenome contains genes that encode components of the electron transport chain similar to those of Naegleria mitogenomes. Homology searches against a draft nuclear genome showed that P. flabellatum has two homologs of the highly conserved Mic60 subunit of the MICOS complex, and likely lost Mic19 and Mic10. However, electron microscopy showed no cristae structures. We infer that P. flabellatum, which originates from high salinity (313‰) water where the dissolved oxygen concentration is low, possesses a mitochondrion capable of aerobic respiration, but with reduced development of cristae structure reflecting limited use of this aerobic capacity (e.g., microaerophily).</jats:p>",

The salt ions in the palisades were excluded from the organelles and were mainly present in the vacuoles. Eventually, the leaf section collapsed because of the high salt in the palisade and spongy cells, but the vascular region in the shriveled section continued to function. The sections adjacent to the dead shriveled section remained green and succulent. The salt tolerance appeared to be based on the exclusion of the salt from the photosynthetic cells and on the ability of the succulent stem to function even though sections were dead owing to high salt concentration. </jats:p>",

The siderophore production capacity of the isolated bacteria was quantified, and a high-yield siderophore-producing strain was selected for further investigation. A total of 33 endophytic bacteria were successfully isolated and identified using a culturable approach. Of these, 10 siderophore-producing bacteria were identified using the selective agar assay, displaying siderophore unit (SU) values ranging from 11.90% to 80.39%. It is noteworthy that Erwinia sp. QZ-E9 exhibited the highest siderophore production capacity, achieving an SU of 80.39%. A microcosm co-cultivation experiment was conducted with the strain QZ-E9 in iron-deficient conditions (2 μmol/L Fe3⁺). The results demonstrated that strain QZ-E9 significantly enhanced the growth of S. portulacastrum, by increases in both fresh weight (1.41 g) and root length (18.7 cm). Furthermore, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was utilized to ascertain the colonization pattern of strain QZ-E9 within the plant roots. The analysis demonstrated that strain QZ-E9 exhibited extensive colonization of the epidermal and outer cortical cells of S. portulacastrum roots, as well as the intercellular spaces and vascular tissues. This colonization indicated that Erwinia sp.

The ion (Cl-, K+, and Na+) contents in seeds and fruits were determined and their likely relationship to germination capacity was addressed. Whether seeds were sown in distilled water or under moderate salt solution (100 mM NaCl) germination of the three proveniences was negatively correlated with the seed K+, Na+ and Cl- content. The spongy coats (fruits) were found to accumulate much more Na+ and Cl- than seeds (up to aprox. 8- and 11- fold, respectively for Na+ and Cl-), indicating that efficient mechanisms may take place in order to protect seeds from the harmful accumulation of salt. In addition, the higher selectivity for K+ vs. Na+ within seeds as compared to fruits seemed to be a determining factor in germination capacity of this species.</jats:p>",

Plants exposed to 0.5 M NaCl (mimicking sea water concentrations) grew larger than plants not exposed to salt. Adding more salt reduced growth, but concentrations up to 2.5 M NaCl were not lethal. Regular tidal flooding with salt water (0.5 M NaCl) did not affect growth or chlorophyll fluorescence, whereas continuous flooding stopped growth while plants survived. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis of plants exposed to 1% oxygen in air revealed induction of selected hypoxia responsive genes, but these genes were not induced during tidal flooding, suggesting that S. europaea did not experience hypoxic stress. Indeed, plants were able to transport oxygen into waterlogged soil.

In this study, twenty-six strains of actinomycetes were isolated from rhizospheric arid soil of the halophyte Atriplex halimus L. ῾Guettaf’ in Biskra province, Algeria. The six isolates that have inhibited at least three phytopathogenic fungi among the five tested (Fusarium oxysporum, Alternaria alternata, Fusarium solani, Aspergillus flavus and Botrytis cinerea) were selected, and have been tested in vitro against phytopathogenic bacteria (Pectobacterium carotovorum and Streptomyces scabies). They were also evaluated for their ability to hydrolyze phosphate, elaborate siderophores, produce indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), and to antagonize S. scabies in vivo (on radish seedlings). Based on the physicochemical analyses, soil samples were categorized as alkaline and extremely-saline. The antagonism results revealed varying antifungal potential among the selected isolates (Act11, Act16, Act17, Act18, Act23 and Act24), about 50% were able to inhibit the growth of F. solani and A. flavus, followed by 33.33% of those having antagonized F. oxysporum, while A. alternata was found to be the most sensitive. Only Act18 has antagonized S. scabies in vitro with an inhibition diameter zone of 19 ± 0.41 mm. However, in vivo trials showed that four isolates have counteracted S. scabies.

IAA was detected in all selected isolates with Act24 being the highest producer (77.45 μg mL−1). Additionally, degradation ability revealed that four isolates were able to hydrolyze phosphate while three exhibited the capacity of elaborating siderophores. The six isolates were assigned to Streptomyces genius according to their morphological, physiological and chemotaxonomical traits. Based on this study, Streptomyces sp. Act18 and Streptomyces sp. Act24 that tolerate 7.5% NaCl concentration, prevent common scab and exhibit some plant growth attributes, may be considered as promising biocontrol agents to be applied in arid and saline soils.</jats:p>",

Current experiment was conducted on salt-affected agricultural land contaminated by shrimp farm at Thandavarayan Sholangan Pettai, Cuddalore district, Tamil Nadu, utilizing Salicornia brachiata a biological tool to assess its efficacy in mitigating salinity. This study was conducted over a period of 4-months to determine the morpho-anatomical variations, biochemical, antioxidant enzymes and soil physico-chemical properties. The results demonstrated that Salicornia brachiata exhibits a robust phytoaccumulation capacity of 290 kg NaCl ha-1 which also led to a decrease in the soil pH from 8.8 to 6.83, electrical conductivity from 5.7 to 1.96 dSm-1 and sodium adsorption ratio from 17.2 to 6.5 mmol L-1. Gradual increase in plant height, biomass, stem thickness, biochemical, and antioxidant enzyme activity was noticed throughout the experimental period when compared to the control. Revegetation can be possible through successive cultivation of Salicornia brachiata in a salt-affected lands, thereby alleviating a significant constraint on crop productivity.</jats:p>",

Sueda fruticosa, Tamarix aphylla, Ceriops candoleana, Cynodon dactylon, and Chenopodum album species were collected form Thatta. Soil samples were collected from the vicinity of each halophyte and were analyzed for pH, organic matter (OM), electrical conductivity (EC), soluble Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, HCO3-, Cl-, sodium absorption ratio (SAR), and exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP). Halophytes species collected were analyzed for ion (Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+and Cl-) contents. Data regarding plant ionic composition showed that contents of Na+ ranged between 3.7-6.9 %, K+0.7-1.9 ,Ca+2 0.4--1.2 %, Mg2+ 0.6-2.2 and Cl- contents between 0.1-0.8 in species collected from Thatta, respectively. Data further revealed that maximum Na+ (6.9 and %) was recorded in Sueda fruticosa and Salsola indica, highest K+(1.9 %) was noted in Chenopodium album species, greatest Ca+2 (1.2 %) was documented in Sueda fruticosaspecies, highest Mg2+ (2.2 %) was observed in Sueda fruticosa whereas, maximum Cl- (0.8 %) was noted in Sueda fruticosa collected from district Thatta, respectively. Data pertaining to soil properties indicated that EC of studied soils ranged between 7.0-18.4dS m-1, pH 7.5-8.0. O.M 0.82-0.94 % , soluble Ca2+ 17.3-33.3 meq L-1, Mg2+ 15.5-24.6 meq L-1, Na+ 43.6-83.4 meq L-1 , Ka+ 3.20-4.50 meq L-1, HCO3? 2.4-5.3 meq L-1, Cl- 55.6-145.4 meq L-1, SAR 10.2-17.1 whereas, ESP ranged between 12.2-19.6 % in soil samples collected from Thatta, respectively. It was concluded that halophyte species Sueda fruticosa, Tamarix aphylla, gallica, Salsola indica, Cyperus irria accumulate significant amounts of salt (Na+ and Cl-)from salt-affected soil and, therefore, may remediate land to the point where native plants could invade and become established, or the site could be returned to agricultural productivity. These halophytes species have an excellent potential for rehabilitation of degraded salt affected soils.</jats:p>",

Pakistan is home to a rich diversity of halophytic flora, convertible into bounteous volumes of bioethanol. On the other hand, the accessibility to the cellulosic part of biomass is a major bottleneck in the successful application of biorefinery processes. The most common pre-treatment procedures existent include physicochemical and chemical approaches, which are not environmentally benign. To overcome these problems, biological pre-treatment has gained importance but the drawback is the low yield of the extracted monosaccharides. The current research was aimed at exploring the best pre-treatment method for the bioconversion of halophyte <jats:italic>Atriplex crassifolia</jats:italic> into saccharides using three thermostable cellulases. <jats:italic>Atriplex crassifolia</jats:italic> was subjected to acid, alkali and microwave pre-treatments, followed by compositional analysis of the pre-treated substrates. Maximum delignification i.e. 56.6% was observed in the substrate pre-treated using 3% HCl. Enzymatic saccharification using thermostable cellulases also validated the results where the highest saccharification yield i.e. 39.5% was observed for the sample pre-treated using same.

The ion-exchange capacity of the cell walls was estimated at different pH and ionic strength of a solution. In the structure of the leaf cell walls, three types of cation-exchange groups were found, namely, two types of carboxylic groups (one of them belongs to galacturonic acid residue) and phenolic OH-groups. The quantities of the groups of each type and their ionization constants were determined. The qualitative composition of the ion-exchange groups in the leaf cell walls was found to be uniform in both plant species regardless of their nutrition. However, the quantity of the carboxylic groups of galacturonic acid depended on the ambient salt concentration in a different manner in the glycophyte and halophyte. This change in the composition of functional groups of cell wall polymers was more pronounced in the halophyte and is apparently one of the responses of these plants to salinization. The sharp increase in the NaCl concentration in the medium leads to a decrease in pH in the extracellular water space due to ion-exchange reactions between sodium ions coming from the external medium and protons of the ionized carboxylic groups of the cell walls. The results are discussed in the aspect of participation of the leaf cell walls in plant responses to salinization.</jats:p>",

Thus, the effects of different factors on germination were evaluated in six representative populations collected from plants cultivated in a uniform environment. In addition, we investigated how the different parts of the seed contributed to dormancy and intraspecific variability. S. phleoides has non-deep physiological dormancy that appeared to be related to its testa. Thereby, dormancy was completely removed with puncturing treatments. High levels of germination were also obtained in seeds stratified at 8°C over 100 days in a solution of nitrates. After-ripening treatment did not have a significant effect in breaking dormancy. Similar germination behaviour and dormancy levels were observed in the different populations, especially when they were subjected to cold stratification. Although further work is needed, cold stratification appears to be the major factor in determining the time of seedling establishment in natural environments for this species.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Biomass availability in arid regions is challenging due to limited arable land and lack of fresh water. In this study, we focus on pyrolysis of two biomasses that are typically abundant agricultural biomasses in arid regions, focusing on understanding the reaction rates and Arrhenius kinetic parameters that describe the pyrolysis reactions of halophyte Salicornia bigelovii, date palm (Phoenix dactylifera) and co-pyrolysis biomass using thermo-gravimetric analysis under non-isothermal conditions. The mass loss data obtained from thermogravimetric analysis of S. bigelovii and date palm revealed the reaction rate peaked between 592 K and 612 K for P. dactylifera leaves and 588 K and 609 K for S. bigelovii at heating rates, 5 K/min, 10 K/min and 15 K/min during the active pyrolysis phase. The activation energy for S. bigelovii and P. dactylifera leaves during this active pyrolysis phase were estimated using the Kissinger method as 147.6 KJ/mol and 164.7 KJ/mol respectively with pre-exponential factors of 3.13 × 109/min and 9.55 × 1010/min for the respective biomasses. Other isoconversional models such as the Flynn-Wall-Ozawa were used to determine these kinetic parameters during other phases of the pyrolysis reaction and gave similar results.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>It is urgent to recover Bohai Bay costal wetland ecosystem because of covering a large area of severe saline-alkali soil. To explore the relationship between halophyte herbaceous succession and microbial community structure, we chose four local communities which played an important role in improving soil microenvironment. We performed phospholipid fatty acid analysis, measured soil parameters, and evaluated shifts of microbial community structure. Results showed that microbial community structure changed significantly along succession and bacteria community was dominant. Total phospholipid fatty acid content increased in different successional stages but decreased with depth, with similar variations in bacterial and fungal biomass. Soil organic carbon and especially total nitrogen were positively correlated with microbial biomass. Colonization of pioneering salt-tolerant plants<jats:italic>Suaeda glauca</jats:italic>in saline-alkali bare land changed total soil microorganism content and composition. These results showed that belowground processes were strongly related with aboveground halophyte succession. Fungal/bacterial ratio, Gram-negative/Gram-positive bacteria ratio, total microbial biomass, and fungi and bacteria content could indicate the degree of succession stages in Bohai Bay wetland ecosystem. And also these findings demonstrated that microbial community biomass and composition evolved along with vegetation succession environmental variables.</jats:p>",

Seedlings of both species were hydroponically subjected during 21 days to 0, 25, 50, and 100 µM NiCl2. Growth parameters showed that the halophyte M. crystallinum was more tolerant to Ni than B. juncea. Malondialdehyde (MDA) content increased to a higher extent in B. juncea than in M. crystallinum. Antioxidant enzymesactivities were differently affected by Ni in both species. Nickel increased shoot superoxide dismutase (SOD) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activities in B. juncea, whereas these activities were reduced in M. crystallinum when exposed to metal stress. The root SOD, APX and guaiacol peroxidase (GPX) activities increased upon Ni treatments for both species. The content of non-enzymatic antioxidative molecules such as glutathione, non-protein thiols and proline increased in Ni-treated plants, except for GSH content in the shoot of B. juncea. Based on the oxidative balance, our findings confirm the higher tolerance of the halophyte M. crystallinum to Ni-induced oxidative stress comparatively to B. juncea. We suggest that M. crystallinum is able to overcome the produced ROS using the non-enzymatic system, while Ni-induced oxidative stress was more acute in B. juncea, leading this species to mainly use the enzymatic system to protect against reactive oxygen species.</jats:p>",

It produces dimorphic seeds with different phenotypic characteristics and seed sizes. However, there is no information regarding the germination biology of these dimorphic seeds. Studies were conducted to evaluate the effects of ecological factors such as temperature, light, pH, osmotic stress, salt concentration, and planting depth on seed germination and seedling emergence. The results showed that brown seeds were nondormant, whereas black seeds had an intermediate physiological dormancy. The germination percentage of brown seeds was more than 80% at all temperature regimes and light conditions, but the optimum germination occurred at the cold thermoperiod of 20/10 C. In contrast, less than 6% of black seeds germinated at all temperature regimes and light conditions. Eight weeks of cold stratification did not break the dormancy of black seeds, whereas low concentrations of gibberellic acid (0.1 and 1.0 mM) significantly increased seed germination. Removal of the testa of black seeds also promoted germination and produced normal seedlings. Brown seeds showed moderate tolerance to salt stress, with 16% germination percentage at a salt concentration of 600 mM NaCl. The germination of brown seeds was 38% at an osmotic potential stress of −0.8 MPa; above that, no germination was obtained. Brown seeds germinated well in a wide pH range (4 to 10), with a germination percentage higher than 95%. Seedling emergence percentage was higher than 90% at burial depths of 0 to 2 cm, while germination percentage severely decreased for brown seeds with burial depths &gt;2 cm, indicating that shallow tillage could be an effective measure to minimize seed germination.

We sampled 30 specimens, from which the leaves, roots, and rhizospheric soil were subjected to 16S rRNA gene sequencing, bringing forth patterns of alpha and beta diversity, taxonomical composition, co-occurrence network, and the core microbiome of each compartment. Overall, this species harbors a very restricted set of endophytic microbes, and communities showed an increasing gradient of complexity (soil &amp;gt; root &amp;gt; leaf), reflecting a change in the main selective pressure being active over the microbial community. Although the leaf bacteriome was influenced basically by host factors, the soil community was modulated by the environment, and the root bacteriome was structured by both factors. These results help us understand how plant–microbe interactions occur in saline environments. As these plants shelter microbes that potentially alleviate abiotic stresses, we discuss how culture-independent methods could contribute to the prospection of plant growth promoting bacteria in plants.</jats:p>",

Pall. The key conserved motifs and glutamates inherent in proteins of the CLC family were identified in SaCLCd, SaCLCf, and SaCLCg amino acid sequences. SaCLCd and SaCLCg were characterized by higher homology to eukaryotic (human) CLCs, while SaCLCf was closer to prokaryotic CLCs. Ion specificities of the SaCLC proteins were studied in complementation assays by heterologous expression of the SaCLC genes in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae GEF1 disrupted strain Δgef1. GEF1 encoded the only CLC family protein, the Cl− transporter Gef1p, in undisrupted strains of this organism. Expression of SaCLCd in Δgef1 cells restored their ability to grow on selective media. The complementation test and the presence of both the “gating” and “proton” conservative glutamates in SaCLCd amino acid sequence and serine specific for Cl− in its selectivity filter suggest that this protein operates as a Cl−/H+ antiporter. By contrast, expression of SaCLCf and SaCLCg did not complement the growth defect phenotype of Δgef1 cells. The selectivity filters of SaCLCf and SaCLCg also contained serine. However, SaCLCf included only the “gating” glutamate, while SaCLCg contained the “proton” glutamate, suggesting that SaCLCf and SaCLCg proteins act as Cl− channels. The SaCLCd, SaCLCf, and SaCLCg genes were shown to be expressed in the roots and leaves of S. altissima. In response to addition of NaCl to the growth medium, the relative transcript abundances of all three genes of S. altissima increased in the leaves but did not change significantly in the roots. The increase in expression of SaCLCd, SaCLCf, and SaCLCg in the leaves in response to increasing salinity was in line with Cl− accumulation in the leaf cells, indicating the possible participation of SaCLCd, SaCLCf, and SaCLCg proteins in Cl− sequestration in cell organelles. Generally, these results suggest the involvement of SaCLC proteins in the response of S. altissima plants to increasing salinity and possible participation in mechanisms underlying salt tolerance.</jats:p>",

In this study, a characterization is presented of the soils surrounding El Hito saline pond (Castilla La Mancha, Central Spain), an ecological halophyte niche within a natural semi‐arid steppe land. The main aim is to classify the salt‐affected soils and their morphology, genesis, and physico‐chemical properties. Four soil profiles were opened with a backhoe machine for sampling and subsequent description on the basis of their pedogenetic morphology. Systematic surface sampling was also performed. Standard methods were followed to measure the soil properties of 27 samples. Overall electrical conductivity (EC) and pH levels of the wetland were mapped (using ArcGIS 3.1.3). Soil salinity at elevated levels was detected, inhibiting plant uptake of water and nutrients. Distinct sub‐areas of extreme elevated surface salinity providing specialized plant habitats and poor soil structure were observed, as well as a mainly whitened‐yellowish‐greenish soil colour due to salt accumulation and poor drainage. The soils also showed alkaline pH values. In most samples, the pH was over 8.5, and EC was higher than 4 (dS m\n                    <jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>\n                    ), and in several samples higher than 20 (dS m\n                    <jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>\n                    ). A low sodium (Na) content was detected in the saturation extract where magnesium (Mg\n                    <jats:sup>+</jats:sup>\n                    ) was the dominant soluble cation, followed by both calcium (Ca\n                    <jats:sup>+</jats:sup>\n                    ) and sodium (Na\n                    <jats:sup>+</jats:sup>\n                    ), and then potassium (K\n                    <jats:sup>+</jats:sup>\n                    ), present in lower proportions.

The percentages of organic carbon (C) were very low, while total nitrogen (TN) and available phosphorus (P) were higher in the upper horizons, suggesting a degree of eutrophication. The present work will increase the existing knowledge about the role of El Hito saline pond, that play a vital ecological role in the broader biosphere, providing new suggestions to readers on how this knowledge can be used to improve these types of ecosystems. In particular, the agricultural pesticides and fertilizers continuously damage the soil fertility as evidenced by the high content of soluble phosphorus found in some points of the Hito saline pond.\n                  </jats:p>",

In this context, our goal was to grow and enhance quinoa growth using native rhizobacteria that can withstand salt stress. To achieve this objective, we isolated rhizobacteria from three saline localities in a semi‐arid region in Tunisia, which are characterized by different halophyte species and tested their plant growth‐promoting (PGP) activities. Then, we inoculated quinoa seedlings cultivated on 300 mM NaCl with the three most efficient rhizobacteria. A positive effect of the three‐salt tolerant rhizobacteria on the growth of quinoa under salinity was observed. In fact, the results of principal component analysis indicated that the inoculation of quinoa by salt‐tolerant PGPR under high salinity had a prominent beneficial effect on various growth and physiological parameters of stressed plant, such as the biomass production, the roots length, the secondary roots number, proline content and photosynthesis activities. Three rhizobacteria were utilized in this investigation, and the molecular identification revealed that strain 1 is related to the <jats:italic>Bacillus inaquosorum</jats:italic> species, strain 2 to <jats:italic>Bacillus thuringiensis</jats:italic> species and strain 3 to <jats:italic>Bacillus proteolyticus</jats:italic> species.

However, the key regulatory mechanisms underlying the effect of salt stress on the initial imbibition stage of quinoa seeds are unclear. In this study, dry seeds (0 h) and imbibed (8 h) seeds with 450 mM NaCl (artificial salt) and 100% brackish water of Yellow River Estuary (BW, natural salt) were used to assess the key salt responses based on germination, transcriptome, and metabolome analyses. The results indicated that the capacity of germinating seeds to withstand these two salt stresses was similar due to the similarities in the germination percentage, germination index, mean germination time, and germination phenotypes. Combined omics analyses revealed that the common and unique pathways were induced by NaCl and BW. Starch and sucrose metabolism were the only commonly enriched pathways in which the genes were significantly changed. Additionally, amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism, and ascorbate and aldarate metabolism were preferably enriched in the NaCl group.

The present work reports the phytochemical profile, as well as antioxidant, antimicrobial and antimutagenic properties of C. maritimum leaf hydro-alcoholic extract. From LC-ESI-MS analysis, eighteen phenolic compounds were depicted in sea fennel extract and the amount of total phenolic content exceeds 3% DW.

An important antimicrobial activity against pathogenic strains was found as well as a strong capacity to inhibit Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 35556) biofilm formation. Sea fennel extracts showed a significant decrease of mutagenesis induced by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and menadione (ME) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae D7 strain.

From the six extracts obtained it was observed that the solvent with the highest extraction efficiency was water, but the extracts in ethanol, N-hexane and SFE are those that showed the highest antioxidant activity (polyphenols, 1,1-Diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and reducing power). On the basis of these results, the SFE extract was chosen to evaluate the antioxidant and anti-aging activity in vitro, by assessing cell vitality and molecular markers (MTT and immunoblotting assays). The results showed that the SFE extract exerted antioxidant activity in vitro, protecting cells from mortality induced by oxidative stress; this protection was also confirmed at the molecular level, by the levels of the protein integrin -1, that is able to prevent the negative effects of a stress situation, such as oxidative stress, that could promote aging and related diseases.

To test this hypothesis, we performed a phylogenetic trait-based framework analysis based on bacterial 16S rRNA gene and fungal nuclear rRNA internal transcribed spacer profiling. Data showed that the dominant α-proteobacteria and γ-proteobacteria communities in bulk soil and root endosphere tend to be phylogenetically clustered and at the same time exhibit phylogenetic over-dispersion in rhizosphere.

Under 150 mM NaCl, PtSOS1 expression levels in roots and ST values at 0.1 mM KCl was significantly lower than that at 5 mM KCl with the prolonging of treatment time. A significant positive correlation was found between root PtSOS1 expression levels and ST values under various concentrations of NaCl, KCl or 150 mM NaCl plus 0.1 or 5 mM KCl treatments. Therefore, it is proposed that PtSOS1 is the major component of selective transport capacity for K+ over Na+ and hence, salt tolerance of P. tenuiflora. Finally, we hypothesise a function model of SOS1 in regulating K+ and Na+ transport system in the membrane of xylem parenchyma cells by sustaining the membrane integrity; it also appears that this model could reasonably explain the phenomenon of Na+ retrieval from the xylem when plants are exposed to severe salt stress.</jats:p>",

The research was conducted in northern Poland, along the Baltic coast in 2013. The present distribution of the two species was compared with historical data and general trends of and threats to these two species were examined. In total, 33 sites of A. tripolium and 18 of P. maritima were found in the research area. The resources of both species have been perceptibly depleting during last 150 years, which is mostly due to human agencies (e.g. habitat devastation caused by growing urban areas and the change in management and/or habitat condition). In order to preserve both species, it may be necessary to start an ex situ conservation program.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Understanding how halophytes survive high soil salinity in realistic long-term experiments is important for strategies to mitigate the effects of increasing soil salinity worldwide. Protective mechanisms in halophytes enabling survival include sequestration of salt via Na+/H+ antiporters, synthesis and accumulation of osmolytes, and activation of protective mechanisms against reactive oxygen species (ROS). Protective mechanisms elicited by a single step-up to a range of NaCl treatments (34–256 mM) in two populations of the halophyte Atriplex halimus L. from contrasting environments (arid steppe and saline coastline) were compared over 6 weeks. The coastal population survived significantly better at high salinity compared with the steppe population, although in both populations, salinity inhibited growth. Increased Na+ and K+ concentration was accompanied by higher induction of Na+/H+ antiporter gene expression in coastal than in steppe population leaves. Osmolytes increased more significantly in the coastal than in the steppe population with greater induction of choline mono-oxygenase gene expression. Activation of ROS scavenging mechanisms was greater in coastal than in steppe plants. Differential responses found through time, in different salt concentrations, and between leaves and roots indicate a finely tuned response. Sharp changes in responses at 171 mM NaCl indicate that different mechanisms may be invoked at different stress levels.</jats:p>",

Two-hundred Alternaria strains were collected from four different pedo-climatic areas in Tunisia, from C. maritima fresh plant tissues showing symptoms of Alternaria infection. Phylogenetic analyses of 79 representative Alternaria strains, were carried out using multi-locus gene sequencing. All the strains clustered in the Alternaria Section: 47 strains had high homology with A. alternata reference strain, 13 grouped with A. arborescens reference strain, 12 grouped with A. mali reference strain, and seven strains were not well defined with A. mali as their closest species. In vitro production of tenuazonic acid (TA), alternariol (AOH), alternariol-monomethyl ether (AME), and altenuene (ALT) was evaluated. Approx. 68% of strains simultaneously produced AOH, AME and TA. Only two A. alternata and one A. mali strains were ALT producing. Pathogenicity tests on leaves of C. maritima were carried out with 41 representative strains. Alternaria arborescens showed the greatest pathogenicity compared to A. alternata and A. mali, although no statistically significant differences in pathogenicity were observed.

Germination, pot experiments, and a biochemical analysis were performed. The effective T. pannonicum’s seed germination was achieved in the control. We demonstrated that halophyte’s organs do not simply tolerate high-salt conditions. The activities of APX, POD, and catalase observed at 400 mM and 800 mM NaCl were varied between organs and revealed the following pattern: root &gt; leaves &gt; stem. Proline was preferentially accumulated in leaves that were more salt-tolerant than other organs. Salt stress enhanced the activity of antioxidant enzymes and concentrations of salinity stress indicators in a time-dependent manner.

In this study, the effect of ambient (400 ppm) and elevated (800 ppm) CO2 concentrations were evaluated on the C4 xero-halophyte Kochia prostrata treated with moderate salinity (200 mM NaCl) and polyethylene glycol (PEG)-induced osmotic stress. Our results indicated that plants grown at elevated CO2 concentration had different responses to osmotic stress and salinity. The synergistic effect of elevated CO2 and osmotic stress increased proline accumulation, but elevated CO2 did not mitigate the negative effects of osmotic stress on dark respiration intensity and photosystem II (PSII) efficiency. This indicates a stressful state, which is accompanied by a decrease in the efficiency of light reactions of photosynthesis and significant dissipative respiratory losses, thereby resulting in growth inhibition. Plants grown at elevated CO2 concentration and salinity showed high Na+ and proline contents, high water-use efficiency and time required to reach the maximum P700 oxidation level (PSI), and low dark respiration. Maintaining stable water balance, the efficient functioning of cyclic transport of PSI, and the reduction of dissipation costs contributed to an increase in dry shoot biomass (2-fold, compared with salinity at 400 ppm CO2).

We tested the hypothesis that, due to its mineral composition, diluted seawater would result in a less stressful growing medium than NaCl. We observed that diluted seawater resulted in a less detrimental growing medium compared to an EC-comparable NaCl solution, with remarkable differences between the salt-tolerant and the salt-sensitive species. While the growth rates in Tetragonia did not vary between the two types of stress, diluted seawater led to a higher FW and DW biomass yield in the salt-sensitive lettuce compared to the NaCl treatment. Moreover, NaCl reduced the water consumption and water productivity in Tetragonia. In lettuce, NaCl-treated plants demonstrated lower water use efficiency and water productivity compared to the EC-comparable seawater treatment.

The effective consortia were selected based on low Na but high P and K shoot concentrations that are variable and are relevant for plant nutrition and salt stress mitigation.

This study investigated the effects of six heavy metals—Molybdenum (Mo), Manganese (Mn), Lead (Pb), Chromium (Cr), Nickel (Ni), and Cadmium (Cd)—on the morphometric leaf traits of the halophyte Lumnitzera racemosa Willd. in an ultramafic mining site in Claver, Surigao del Norte, with a non-mining control site in Nasipit, Agusan del Norte. Sediment analyses revealed that Cr (4,434 ppm) and Ni (4,234 ppm) in the mining site exceeded WHO and FAO permissible limits (100 and 50 ppm, respectively), while Ni (552 ppm) and Cr (334 ppm) in the control site also surpassed thresholds, indicating diffuse contamination. Morphometric analysis showed significant differences (p &lt; 0.05) in all measured leaf traits between sites. L. racemosa in Nasipit exhibited longer leaves (mean = 5.17 cm) and greater leaf area (mean = 7.53 cm²) compared with Claver (4.17 cm and 6.83 cm², respectively), representing increases of 22% in length and 9% in area. In contrast, leaves from Claver had broader widths (by 12%) and longer petioles (by 15%), possibly reflecting compensatory morphological plasticity under multi-metal stress. The widespread contamination of all six heavy metals likely induced synergistic or antagonistic toxic effects, altering cell division and photosynthetic activity. Leaf macronutrient analysis revealed nitrogen deficiency in both populations, optimum to high phosphorus, and excessive potassium levels, suggesting that leaf size variations were not driven by nutrient imbalance but by metal toxicity and environmental stress. The study concludes that L. racemosa exhibits adaptive morphometric responses to heavy metal exposure, indicating its potential as a bioindicator species for monitoring contamination in ultramafic and mining-affected mangrove ecosystems.</jats:p>",

Herein, with aim to determine the genes associated with salt tolerance, transcriptome sequencing was performed on its stem, leaves and root over three set NaCl gradients regimens at treatment intervals of 3 h and 5 days. From our findings, we identified 829,095 unigenes, with 331,394 being successfully matched to at least one annotation database. In roots, under 3 h treatment, no up-regulated DEGs were identified in 100 and 500 mM NaCl treated samples. Under 5 days treatment, 97, 60 and 242 up-regulated DEGs were identified in 100, 300, 500 mM NaCl treated samples, respectively. We identified 50, 22 and 255 down-regulated DEGs in 100, 300, 500 mM NaCl treated samples, respectively. GO biological process enrichment analysis established that down-regulated DEGs were associated with nitrogen compound transport, organic substance transport and intracellular protein transport while the up-regulated genes were enriched in cell wall biogenesis, such as plant-type cell wall biogenesis, cell wall assembly, extracellular matrix organization and plant-type cell wall organization.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In this work we studied the effect of salinity (ranging from 50 to 500 mM NaCl) on the physiological and the antioxidant responses of the local halophyte Limonium delicatulum Kuntze. We based our analysis on 12 biochemical assays that are commonly used to measure the antioxidant responses under stress such as oxidative stress markers, enzymes activities and polyphenolic compounds. Our aim was to study parameters that are strongly correlated with the growth response to salinity. Results showed two different growth responses depending on the concentration of NaCl in the medium. Under 50 to 200 mM, the growth was stimulated before it decreased significantly at 300–500 mM. L. delicatulum revealed a good aptitude to maintain photosynthetic machinery by increasing the concentrations of photosynthetic pigments, which is essential for the stabilisation of photosystems and the photosynthesis process under optimal NaCl concentration. Their breakdown at higher salinity decreased the photosynthetic performance of plants resulting in growth inhibition. Moreover, to reduce the damaging effect of oxidative stress and to tolerate the accumulation of salt ions, L. delicatulum induced the activities of their antioxidant enzymes more than their contents in polyphenolic compounds.</jats:p>",

Therefore, experiment consisted of seven different salt treatments CK: distilled water control; T1: saline-alkali solution of 5 g/L; T2: saline-alkali solution of 10 g/L; T3: saline-alkali solution of 15 g/L; T4: saline-alkali solution of 20 g/L; T5: saline-alkali solution of 25 g/L; T6: saline-alkali solution of 30 g/L.

The results indicated that the T6 treatment (saline-alkali solution of 30 g/L) strongly decreased the plant height, stem thickness, leaf area and SPAD value of ice plants, and obviously suppressed the shoot and root biomass with the increase in salinity. While T2 treatment (saline-alkali solution of 10 g/L) application significantly increased the root activity, soluble sugar, soluble protein, vitamin C and flavonoid content, POD (Peroxidase), AsA (reduced ascorbate), MDA (Malondialdehyde), and reduced the proline content; H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, K<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> content, Na<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> content, Cl<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> content, and ratio of Na<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>/K<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>, respectively.

Furthermore, we discovered that the piliferous <jats:italic>S. ferganica</jats:italic> leaves were more effective in retaining water than the glabrous <jats:italic>S. aralocaspica</jats:italic> leaves, and the dense trichome layer exhibited a significantly unwettable surface (high contact angle with droplets), whereas the individual trichomes retained water effectively (more so under drought conditions). The combination of these two properties is consistent with the ‘rose petal effect’, which describes rough surfaces that are hydrophobic but exhibit high adhesion with water.

The two species were examined for anatomical changes under air pollution, and key factors including leaf blade thickness, palisade parenchyma cell height, spongy parenchyma cell diameter, epidermal characteristics, and stomatal traits were assessed. Under pollution, the leaves displayed smaller and denser stomata and idioblasts in the palisade and spongy parenchyma. These anatomical responses suggest that N. retusa and A. halimus could be effective bioindicators for detecting cement dust pollutants. Their leaf relative water content (RWC) exhibited a range of values: 70.1% and 87% for N. retusa and 64.8% to 74.2% for A. halimus on the highly polluted site (S1) and the control site (S4), respectively. Notably, a statistically significant site effect was observed (p &gt; 0.01), confirming previous studies, and indicating reduced leaf relative water content (RWC) values in plants exposed to heavy metals like Cd and Pb. Heavy metals can lead to mineralization by binding to cell walls, altering their physicochemical properties and plasticity. Furthermore, significant correlations between specific heavy metals and histological parameters in A. halimus leaves indicated potential interactions between metal composition and leaf structure, highlighting their role in modulating anatomical adaptations.

Cakile maritima alleviates sodium toxicity through different strategies, including anatomical and morphological adaptations, ion transport regulation, biosynthesis of osmolytes, and activation of antioxidative mechanisms. The species is potentially useful as a cash crop for the so-called biosaline agriculture due to its production of secondary metabolites of medical and nutritional interest and the high oil accumulation in its seeds. In this review, we highlight the relevance of this species as a model for studying the basic mechanisms of salt tolerance and for sustainable biosaline agriculture in the context of soil salination and climate change.</jats:p>",

Thirty days after transplanting, plants grown with100 mM NaCl had the highest productivity and the fastest leaf growth followed by those with 0, 200 and 300 mM NaCl. Grown with 300 mM NaCl, purslane had the lowest specific leaf area due to its highest leaf dry matter content and its lowest water content. All plants had similar values of leaf succulence except for those with 300 mM NaCl. Total chlorophyll and carotenoids contents were significantly higher in plants grown with 0 and 100 mM NaCl than with 200, and 300 mM NaCl. All plants had F<jats:sub>v</jats:sub>/F<jats:sub>m</jats:sub> ratios close to 0.8.

However, salinity seems to increase Fe concentration.

Using ecophysiological and proteomic analyses, we address these phenomena in two Tunisian accessions of the oilseed halophyte, Cakile maritima Scop., thriving on arid and semi-arid Mediterranean bioclimatic stages (Djerba and Raoued, respectively), with a special emphasis on the leaves. Changes in biomass, photosynthetic gas exchange and pigment concentrations in C. maritima plants treated with three salinity levels (0, 100 and 300 mM NaCl) were monitored for 1 month. Comparative two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) revealed 94 and 56 proteins of differential abundance in Raoued and Djerba accessions, respectively. These salinity-responsive proteins were mainly related to photosynthesis and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Although Djerba accession showed a lower biomass productivity, it showed a slightly higher CO2 assimilation rate than Raoued accession when salt-treated. Photosynthesis impairment in both accessions under salinity was also suggested by the lower abundance of proteins involved in Calvin cycle and electron transfer. A significant increase of protein spots involved in the OXPHOS system was found in Djerba accession, suggesting an increase in mitochondrial respiration for increased ATP production under saline conditions, whereas a lesser pronounced trend was observed for Raoued accession. The latter showed in addition higher abundance of proteins involved in photorespiration. Salt-challenged plants of Djerba also likely developed mechanisms for scavenging ROS in leaves as shown by the increase in superoxide dismutase and thioredoxin, while an opposite trend was found in Raoued.</jats:p>",

While responses to individual stresses are well understood, less is known about their combined impact. Here, we treated quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa) seedlings with salt (0 and 200 mM NaCl) under either photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) or PAR supplemented with UV-B radiation (313 nm, 1 hour/day, 1.71 W/m2) to investigate their response to combined salt and UV-B stress. While salinity had minimal effects on plant growth, it decreased stomatal conductance and photochemical efficiency by 36–47%. UV-B supplementation mitigated the negative effects of salinity, enhancing photosynthetic efficiency and water relations in UV-B- and salt-treated plants. Enhanced leaf water relations in the combined treatment were associated with altered ion translocation and shoot compartmentalization, especially for K+. Indeed, UV-B decreased K+ accumulation in epidermal bladder cells, suggesting a redistribution from epidermal bladder cells to other leaf tissues. UV-B treatment shifted plant metabolism towards producing hydroxycinnamic acid, while quercetin levels remained unchanged, indicating minimal stress. This study describes a protective mechanism in quinoa where UV-B radiation enhances ion translocation, water relations, and metabolic adjustments, mitigating salinity stress. Our findings offer key insights into plant resilience and physiological adaptation in salt-affected environments under elevated UV-B exposure.</jats:p>",

This study included the analysis of the salt gland structure, composed of 12 cells, 4 secretory and 8 accessory. Several anatomical, physiological and biochemical responses to stress were also analysed in adult plants subjected to one month of water stress, complete lack of irrigation, and salt stress, by watering with aqueous solutions of 200, 400, 600 and 800 mM NaCl. Plant growth was inhibited by the severe water deficit and, to a lesser extent, by high NaCl concentrations. A variation in the anatomical structure of the leaves was detected under conditions of salt and water stress; plants from the salt stress treatment showed salt glands sunken between epidermal cells, bordered by very large epidermal cells, whereas in those from the water stress treatment, the epidermal cells were heterogeneous in shape and size. In both, the palisade structure of the leaves was altered. Salt excretion is usually accompanied by the accumulation of salts in the foliar tissue. This was also found in L. angustebracteatum, in which the concentration of all ions analysed was higher in the leaves than in the roots. The increase of K+ in the roots of plants subjected to water stress was also remarkable. The multivariate analysis indicated differences in water and salt stress responses, such as the accumulation of Na and Cl, or proline, but K+ homeostasis played a relevant role in the mechanism of tolerance to both stressful conditions.</jats:p>",

The accumulations of numerous flavonoids, saccharides and alcohols were extensively enhanced in the roots of <jats:italic>L. chinensis</jats:italic>, but rarely enhanced in the leaves, under alkali-stress conditions. Enhanced accumulations of flavonoids, saccharides and alcohols increased the removal of reactive oxygen species and alleviated oxygen damage caused by alkali stress.

Thus, increases in guard cell cytosolic Na<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> concentration in <jats:italic>A. tripolium</jats:italic> but not in <jats:italic>A. amellus</jats:italic>, lead to a delayed (20–30 min) and dramatic deactivation of the K<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> inward rectifier.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Salinization hinders the restoration of vegetation in salt-affected soils by negatively impacting plant growth and development. Halophytes play a key role in the restoration of saline and degraded lands due to unique features explaining their growth aptitude in such extreme ecosystems. Suaeda fruticosa is an euhalophyte well known for its medicinal properties and its potential for saline soil phytoremediation. However, excessive salt accumulation in soil limits the development of this species. Research findings increasingly advocate the use of extremophile rhizosphere bacteria as an effective approach to reclaim salinized soils, in conjunction with their salt-alleviating effect on plants. Here, a pot experiment was conducted to assess the role of a halotolerant plant growth-promoting actinobacterium, Glutamicibacter sp., on the growth, nutritional status, and shoot content of proline, total soluble carbohydrates, and phenolic compounds in the halophyte S. fruticosa grown for 60 d under high salinity (600 mM NaCl). Results showed that inoculation with Glutamicibacter sp. significantly promoted the growth of inoculated plants under stress conditions. More specifically, bacterial inoculation increased the shoot concentration of proline, total polyphenols, potassium (K+), nitrogen (N), and K+/Na+ ratio in shoots, while significantly decreasing Na+ concentrations. These mechanisms partly explain S. fruticosa tolerance to high saline concentrations. Our findings provide some mechanistic elements at the ecophysiological level, enabling a better understanding of the crucial role of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPRs) in enhancing halophyte growth and highlight their potential for utilization in restoring vegetation in salt-affected soils.</jats:p>",

As a result, the endophytes residing within the plant produce specific compounds that promote the plant’s growth and defend it against pathogens. Plants and algae symbiotically harbor endophytes, i.e., microbes and microorganisms living within them. The objective of this study is to isolate endophytic fungi, specifically strains of Aspergillus terreus, from the leaves of the salt-tolerant plant Tetraena qatarensis and to explore the salt tolerance, antagonistic activity, and growth promotion properties. Strain C A. terreus (ON117337.1) was screened for salt tolerance and antagonistic effects. Regarding salt tolerance, the isolate demonstrated the ability to thrive in a concentration of up to 10% NaCl. A. terreus showed inhibitory activity against four fungal phytopathogens, namely Fusarium oxysporum, Alternaria alternata, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, and Botrytis cinerea. The GC-MS investigation of the fungal (strain C Aspergillus terreus) extract showed the presence of about 66 compounds (secondary metabolites). Secondary metabolites (SMs) are produced, like Hexadecanoic acid, which aids in controlling phytopathogens. Also produced is lovastatin, which is used to treat hypercholesterolemia. Strain C, which showed salinity tolerance and the highest inhibitory activity, was further analyzed for its effect on tomato seed germination under pathogen stress from Fusarium oxysporum. The greenhouse experiment indicated that the fungi increased the length of tomato seedlings and the plant biomass. Therefore, the selected endophytes derived from Tetraena qatarensis were scrutinized for their potential as biocontrol agents, aiming to thwart fungal pathogens and stimulate plant growth. The in vitro and in vivo assessments of strain C (Aspergillus terreus) against Fusarium oxysporum in this investigation indicate the promising role of endophytes as effective biological control agents. Investigating novel bio-products offers a sustainable approach to agriculture, gradually reducing dependence on chemical fungicides.</jats:p>",

Numbers of benefits are offered by hydroponic systems such as the ability to save water, enhance nutrients use efficiency, easy environmental control, and prevention of soil-borne diseases. However, the high consumption of chemical fertilizers for nutrient solution and the sensitivity of closed hydroponic systems to salinity are issues that need solutions. Thus, the main goal of our research activities is to isolate plant growth promoting fungi in order to develop sustainable hydroponic systems. We are working on isolating and testing the possibility to incorporate the cell-free filtrate (CFF) of plant growth promoting fungi (PGPF) in the composition of the nutrient solution. In this work, we isolated six strains of PGPF from the rhizosphere of the halophyte grass Aeluropus littoralis. Phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequences amplified by ITS1 and ITS4 primers identified the isolated fungi as: Byssochlamys spectabilis, Chaetomium globosum, Cephalotheca foveolata, Penicillium melinii, Alternaria tenuissima, and Nigrospora chinensis. The promoting of vigor in tobacco seedlings was used as criteria to evaluate the biostimulant activity of these fungi by adding either their mycelia (DE: direct effect) or their cell-free filtrates (CFF: indirect effect) to the plant-growth media. The best significant growth stimulation was obtained with plants treated by B. spectabilis. However, only the CFFs of Byssochlamys spectabilis (A5.1) and Penicillium melinii (A8) when added at a dilution factor of 1/50 to half-strength nutritive solution (0.5NS) resulted in significant improvement of all assessed growth parameters. Indeed, the A5.1CFF and A8CFF in 0.5NS induced a significant better increase in the biomass production when compared to NS or 0.5NS alone. All fungi produced indole acetic acid in the CFFs, which could be one of the key factors explaining their biostimulant activities. Furthermore, six genes involved in nitrogen-metabolism (NR1 and NRT1), auxin biosynthesis (Tryp1 and YUCCA6-like), and brassinosteroid biosynthesis (DET2 and DWF4) were shown to be induced in roots or leaves following treatment of plants with the all CFFs. This work opens up a prospect to study in deep the biostimulant activity of PGPFs and their applications to decrease the requirement of chemical fertilizers in the hydroponic growing systems.</jats:p>",

Canavalia rosea, a seashore and mangrove-accompanied halophyte with strong adaptability to adversity in tropical and subtropical regions, is a good model for studying the molecular mechanisms underlying extreme saline-alkaline and drought stress tolerance in leguminous plants. In this study, a PIP2 gene (CrPIP2;3) was cloned from C. rosea, and its expression patterns and physiological roles in yeast and Arabidopsis thaliana heterologous expression systems under high salt-alkali and high osmotic stress conditions were examined. The expression of CrPIP2;3 at the transcriptional level in C. rosea was affected by high salinity and alkali, high osmotic stress, and abscisic acid treatment. In yeast, the expression of CrPIP2;3 enhanced salt/osmotic and oxidative sensitivity under high salt/osmotic and H2O2 stress. The overexpression of CrPIP2;3 in A. thaliana could enhance the survival and recovery of transgenic plants under drought stress, and the seed germination and seedling growth of the CrPIP2;3 OX (over-expression) lines showed slightly stronger tolerance to high salt/alkali than the wild-type. The transgenic plants also showed a higher response level to high-salinity and dehydration than the wild-type, mostly based on the up-regulated expression of salt/dehydration marker genes in A. thaliana plants. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) staining results indicated that the transgenic lines did not possess stronger ROS scavenging ability and stress tolerance than the wild-type under multiple stresses. The results confirmed that CrPIP2;3 is involved in the response of C. rosea to salt and drought, and primarily acts by mediating water homeostasis rather than by acting as an ROS transporter, thereby influencing physiological processes under various abiotic stresses in plants.</jats:p>",

Seeds collected from saline and non-saline habitats were germinated at six salinity levels (0–500 mM NaCl) and incubated at three temperatures and under two light regimes. Studied germination attributes were final germination, germination rate index (GRI) and germination recovery of non-germinated seeds when transferred to distilled water. The results showed insignificant difference in salt tolerance between seeds of the two habitat types at the lower salinities. At higher salinities (400 and 500 mM NaCl), germination of the saline habitat seeds was almost inhibited, but that of non-saline habitat seeds reached various levels depending on light and temperature. Both higher temperatures and darkness resulted in significant reductions of the final germination at the higher salinities. Seeds of the two habitats that did not germinate in the different treatments recovered their germination when transferred to distilled water, indicating that these seeds maintained their viability in saline solution and were able germinate upon the arrival of suitable conditions. Seeds of the two habitats germinated within 2 days at the lower salinities and GRI decreased with the increase in salinity level. Such reduction was obvious for seeds of the saline habitat. Recovery was faster for seeds of the saline habitats, especially for those incubated at higher salinities and in the dark. The difference in dormancy and germination attributes of seeds of the two habitat types reflects ecological adaptations for survival in salt marshes of arid deserts.</jats:p>",

Na+/H+ exchange was absent from roots of control and NaCl-treated plants. In contrast, leaves showed constitutive Na+/H+ exchange that was enhanced by growth of the plants in NaCl. Highest activity was measured in the epidermal bladder cells in agreement with the highest concentrations of Na+ found in this tissue. Tonoplast H+-translocating ATPase activity was also greatest in this tissue, as were protein levels for myo- inositol- O -methyltransferase, a key enzyme in the pinitol biosynthesis pathway. The strong correlation between Na+/H+ exchange and Na+ accumulation confirms the role of this transporter in vacuolar sequestration of Na+ and plant salt tolerance.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: Nitraria sibirica Pall. is one of the pioneer tree species in saline–alkali areas due to its extreme salt tolerance. However, the lack of information on its genome limits the further exploration of the molecular mechanisms in N. sibirica under salt stress. Methods: In this study, we used single-molecule real-time (SMRT) technology based on the PacBio Iso-Seq platform to obtain transcriptome data from N. sibirica under salt treatment for the first time, which is helpful for our in-depth analysis of the salt tolerance and molecular characteristics of N. sibirica. Results: Our results suggested that a total of 234,508 circular consensus sequences (CCSs) with a mean read length of 2121 bp were obtained from the 19.26 Gb raw data. Furthermore, based on transcript cluster analysis, 93,713 consensus isoforms were obtained, including 92,116 high-quality isoforms. After removing redundant sequences, 49,240 non-redundant transcripts were obtained from high-quality isoforms. A total of 37,261 SSRs, 1816 LncRNAs and 47,314 CDSs, of which 40,160 carried complete ORFs, were obtained. Based on our transcriptome data, we also analyzed the coding genes of H+-PPase, and the results of both bioinformatics and functional analyses indicated that the gene prediction via full-length transcripts obtained by SMRT technology is reliable and effective. In summary, our research data obtained by SMRT technology provides more reliable and accurate information for the further analysis of the regulatory network and molecular mechanism of N. sibirica under salt stress.</jats:p>",

This plant has succulent leaves and grape-like fruits and is a potential horticultural plant. To obtain the efficient sterilization method and optimal culture conditions, two types of seeds produced from a single plant of S. aralocaspica were treated with 75% ethanol for different time durations first, and then sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) or mercury chloride (HgCl2), with five different timing treatments were used for second seed surface sterilization. Sterilized seeds were germinated on a Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium at different potential hydrogenation (pH) levels, to examine germination and seedling performance. The results showed that the highest germination percentage of brown seeds was 100% and that of black seeds was 17%. Thus, brown seeds were more suitable for further culture experiments than black seeds. For brown seeds, the sterilization effect of NaClO was better than that of HgCl2, based on the results of seed germination, contamination, and seedling survival. Rinsing with 75% ethanol for 60 s, sterilizing with NaClO for 8 min, and cultivating at pH 8.0 MS for 7 days was the best of all sterilization procedures and cultivation methods tested, which has been successfully applied to S. aralocaspica in vitro culture. The optimized protocol described here can be used as the reference for the Suaeda genus.</jats:p>",

The results showed that the inflorescences exhibit high antioxidant activity, the degree of inhibition at 20 µl of the studied material is 9 times greater. compared with ascorbic acid and 3 times compared with emoxypine. In addition, tamarisk extracts have shown noticeable antibacterial properties against the Staphylococcus aureus strain. The strongest activity was recorded in 70% of the water-alcohol extract of inflorescences at a minimum concentration of 1 to 10. These data indicate that tamarix can be considered as an interesting source of antioxidants for the therapeutic or nutraceutical industry and for food production.

The present work investigates the metabolic and physiological adaptation mechanisms in the xero‐halophyte <jats:italic>Haloxylon salicornicum</jats:italic> to counter the effects of drought. This xero‐halophyte can withstand a prolonged drought period of 14 days and recovered within 7 days of irrigation with minimal effects of drought on growth and physiological parameters. Photosynthetic parameters such as P<jats:sub>N</jats:sub>, g<jats:sub>s</jats:sub>, and E decreased significantly, whereas WUE increased under drought condition.

Differential regulations of various antioxidative enzymes increase the drought tolerance potential of <jats:italic>H. salicornicum</jats:italic>. The metabolomic analysis of <jats:italic>H. salicornicum</jats:italic> shoot identified 63 metabolites: 43 significantly increased and 20 significantly decreased under drought conditions. These metabolites mainly include amino acids, organic acids, amines, sugar alcohols, sugars, fatty acids, alkaloids, and phytohormones.

The structure reveals a highly ordered, multilayered solvation shell that can be seen to be organized into one dominant network covering much of the exposed surface accessible area to an extent not seen in almost any other protein structure solved.

This is particularly true for coastal halophytes like the annual oilseed species Cakile maritima, which faces the simultaneous impact of wind, salt-spray and seawater inundations in its natural biotopes. At the early developmental stages, this may jeopardize seed germination, plant establishment capacity and hence its development and persistence. Osmopriming is a pre-sowing approach aiming to improve seedling emergence and establishment in adverse environments. Here, we investigate the effect of proline (at 0, 1, 5, and 20 mM) pre-treatment on salt tolerance of C. maritima at the juvenile stage under salinity (0, 100, and 200 mM NaCl). Proline seed priming enhanced the germination rate (28% to 92%) and promoted seedling establishment of C. maritima by stimulating α-amylase activity even at the highest salinity (+55 %). Besides, after transfer of non-germinated seeds on distilled water, salt impact was fully reversible. At the seedling stage, chlorophyll fluorescence parameters showed that this osmoticum increased the maximal quantum yield of PSII photochemistry (Fv/Fm) and the quantum yield of photochemical energy conversion [Y(II)]. In contrast, the quantum yield of nonregulated nonphotochemical energy dissipation [Y(NO)] and the quantum yield of regulated nonphotochemical energy dissipation [Y(NPQ)], which might be correlated to the mitigation of the salt deleterious effects on PSII. Proline and carbohydrate concentrations also increased following priming. Overall, our data provide strong arguments for using proline at low doses (1 and 5 mM) as a successful priming agent to alleviate salinity-induced adverse effect on plants.</jats:p>",

Additionally, the activities of peroxidase and glutathione peroxidase, and the peroxiredoxin abundance were increased for ROS scavenging. Furthermore, ion toxicity was relieved through Na<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> influx restriction and compartmentalization, and osmotic homeostasis reestablishment due to glycine betaine accumulation. Importantly, two transcription factors were increased for regulating specific alkali-responsive gene expression.

This study investigates a novel adsorbent—ferrite composite of biochar (FCOB) for Congo red (CR) dye removal. It was synthesized by pyrolyzing Suaeda monoica leaf powder to obtain biochar, followed by base treatment to produce base-treated biochar, and subsequent coprecipitation with NiCuZnFe₂O₄ ferrite spinel. The XRD analysis of FCOB confirmed the successful incorporation of spinel NiCuZnFe2O4 into FCOB, as evidenced by the presence of two prominent characteristic peaks of the spinel structure. The SEM image revealed the irregular-crumpled structure of FCOB. BET analysis revealed the mesoporosity in FCOB, with a surface area of 44.64 ± 0.2396 m2 g−1. The optimum adsorption was achieved at a pH of 2, adsorbent dosage of 20 mg, initial CR concentration of 50 mg/L, contact time of 320 min, and temperature of 85 °C. The maximum CR dye removal percentage (R%) was 99.75%. At pH = 2, the strong electrostatic attraction between protonated FCOB adsorbent and anionic CR seemed to be the dominant adsorption mechanism. The adsorption data was best (R\n                  2 = 0.99) described by the Redlich–Peterson isotherm model, indicating a heterogeneous surface with some degree of monolayer adsorption. The maximum adsorption capacity estimated from the Langmuir model was q\n                  max = 239.80 mg/g. The adsorption kinetics data was best described by pseudo-second-order model (R\n                  2 = 0.99), suggesting that chemisorption is likely the rate-limiting step. The CR adsorption process was spontaneous and endothermic with ΔH° = 71.02 ± 1.41 kJ/mol. ANN analysis revealed that both BR and LM algorithms accurately predicted removal efficiency and adsorption capacity, achieving R values greater than 0.995. FCOB could also be regenerated and recycled up to 5 cycles retaining ≅65% removal efficiency for CR. Therefore, FCOB can serve as a biodegradable, cost-effective, nontoxic, and renewable adsorbent in treating CR-dye contaminated industrial wastewater, especially from textile and printing sectors.</jats:p>",

Increased leaf necrosis in all populations under salt stress indicated a higher NaCl sensitivity in winter than in summer. Plants from inland populations were more sensitive than salt‐marsh populations. Inland and salt‐marsh populations showed similar capacities for seasonal osmotic adjustment, high seasonal increase of praline concentration and long‐term betaine accumulation. Inland and salt‐marsh populations allocated Na and Cl preferentially to the shoot. In inland populations, Na and Cl accumulated to high concentrations in leaves, whereas the much lower NaCl concentration in salt‐marsh populations suggested that in these plants, Na uptake was regulated to match the growth‐dependent ion demand of the shoot. The prevention of NaCl accumulation in times of slow growth by a NaCl homoeostasis system seemed to be an important adaptation with respect to the survival of evergreen plants in salt marshes.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This study was designed to isolate and characterize endophytic and rhizospheric bacteria associated with the halophyte plant Sesuvium verrucosum, grown under extreme salinity soil in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The plant growth promotion activities of isolated bacterial were evaluated in vitro. A total of 19 salt tolerant endophytic and rhizospheric bacterial isolates were obtained and grouped into six according to genetic similarity based on RAPD data. These six isolates were identified by amplification and partial sequences of 16S rDNA as Enterobacter cancerogenus,Vibrio cholerae, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli and two Enterobacter sp. Isolates were then grown until exponential growth phase to evaluate the atmospheric nitrogen fixation, phosphate solubilization, and production of phytohormones such as indole-3-acetic acid, as well as 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase activity. While, All of the six strains were negative for ACC deaminaseactivity, two isolates showed Nitrogen fixation activity, three isolates produce the plant hormone (Indole acetic acid) and two isolates have the activity of solubiliztion of organic phosphate. Among the six isolates, the isolate (R3) from the soil around the roots is able to perform the three previous growth promoting possibilities together and it is ideal for use in promoting the growth of plants under the high salinity conditions. This isolate is candidate to prepare a friendly biofertelizer that can be used for the improvement of the crops performance under salinity conditions.Int J Appl Sci Biotechnol, Vol 3(3): 552-560</jats:p>",

The variation of phenolic compounds, the antioxidant and antibacterial activities of different extracts of different organs of sea fennel were investigated. The roots, stems, leaves and seeds were collected from three bioclimatic stages of Tunisia. Solvent fractionation method (using aqueous acetone, petroleum ether and ethyl acetate) was adopted to separate the extract ingredient and to concentrate phenolics. Total phenolics, total flavonoids, and condensed tannins significantly varied between organs and localities. In leaves, the highest level of phenols was detected in the upper and sub-humid zones. However, in stems the high amounts of phenols were observed in semiarid climate. The antioxidant activity was evaluated through four different methods and the antimicrobial activity was assessed against five human pathogenic bacteria and a fungal strain. Multivariate analysis showed significant effect of organ and locality on the antioxidant properties. Results of the antibacterial activities showed significant differences among extracts and was reflected by a large spectrum of activity ranging from totally not active (Zones of inhibition (zi) &lt; 1 mm) to very high activity (zi &gt;16 mm). Combined statistical results allowed to select the more potent fraction to be analyzed using reversed-phase HPLC (RP-HPLC). The flavanol epigallocatechin was identified as a major phenolic compound which contributed greatly to the antioxidant capacity. The results established in this study highlighted the importance of this halophyte cash crop in the human diet as natural source of active components.</jats:p>",

The C3 crop model in a changing climate is Chenopodium quinoa Willd—a protein-rich pseudohalphyte (Amaranthaceae). Morphophysiological, biochemical and molecular genetic studies were performed on quinoa grown at ambient (400 ppm, aCO2) and elevated (800 ppm, eCO2) CO2 concentrations, drought (D) and/or high temperature (eT) treatments. Among the single factors, drought caused the greatest stress response, inducing disturbances in the light and dark photosynthesis reactions (PSII, apparent photosynthesis) and increasing oxidative stress (MDA). Futhermore, compensation mechanisms played an important protective role against eT or eCO2. The disruption of the PSII function was accompanied by the activation of the expression of PGR5, a gene of PSI cyclic electron transport (CET). Wherein under these conditions, the constant Rubisco content was maintained due to an increase in its biosynthesis, which was confirmed by the activation of rbcL gene expression. In addition, the combined stress treatments D+eT and eCO2+D+eT caused the greatest negative effect, as measured by increased oxidative stress, decreased water use efficiency, and the functioning of protective mechanisms, such as photorespiration and the activity of antioxidant enzymes. Furthermore, decreased PSII efficiency and increased non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) were not accompanied by the activation of protective mechanisms involving PSI CET. In summary, results show that the greatest stress experienced by C. quinoa plants was caused by drought and the combined stresses D+eT and eCO2+D+eT. Thus, drought consistently played a decisive role, leading to increased oxidative stress and a decrease in defense mechanism effectiveness.</jats:p>",

This study explored the potential of Tetragonia tetragonoides (Pall.)

This study also introduced a novel callus culture system for NZS, allowing for the rapid in vitro production of secondary metabolites. Optimal callus induction (100%) and biomass production (0.416 g) were achieved by adding 2.0 mg·L−1 6-BA (6-Benzylaminopurine) and 0.5 mg·L−1 2,4-D (2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) among five auxin and cytokinin combinations. Two distinct callus types, TGC [TDZ (Thidiazuron)-supplemented Green Callus] and TNYC [TDZ + NAA (Naphthalene acetic acid)-supplemented Yellow Callus], were identified, each with unique characteristics. The calli showed total phenolic and flavonoid contents comparable to those of NZS leaves grown in the greenhouse. An expression analysis of six genes (CHS, CHI, F3H, F3′H, FLS, and DFR) involved in the kaempferol biosynthesis revealed an enhanced flavonoid biosynthesis-related gene expression in TGC, emphasizing its potential for compound production. GC-MS analysis identified distinct compound profiles in TGC and TNYC, with 2,3-butanediol and succinic acid being the predominant compounds among the nine and forty-four components, respectively. These calli offer a stable supply of functional compounds and present an environmentally sustainable solution. The derived callus culture system is anticipated to contribute to the development of healthy functional foods or pharmaceuticals from halophyte NZS.</jats:p>",

Plants were subjected to varying salinity treatments from 0, 50, 100,150, and 200 mM prepared by adding sodium chloride (NaCl) to the nutrient solution. Salinity significantly influenced the mineral, proximate, antinutrient, and phytochemical composition of <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\"><jats:italic>T. ciliata</jats:italic></jats:styled-content>. Control and 50 mM treatments recorded significantly higher macro and micronutrient content in the flower buds and leaves, except for heavy metals such as Zn and Cu, which increased with increasing salinity and significantly higher in the roots. Leaves under low salinity treatments recorded higher moisture and protein content, while leaves also recorded higher ash content under high salinity. On the other hand, flower buds under low salinity recorded significantly high fat and NDF composition. Phytochemicals and antinutrients increased with increasing salinity concentrations. The low antinutrient content and high nutritional, mineral and phenolic contents validate the edibility and suitability of <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\"><jats:italic>T. ciliata</jats:italic></jats:styled-content> for human consumption.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The current study reports effects of salt stress on growth, K+ nutrition and organic composition of Atriplex nummularia. The upper limit of the NaCl gradient imposed on the plants was close to seawater salinity (600 mM). An external NaCl of 150 mM improved the growth of this species, which corroborates its halophytic nature. Evidence show that Atriplex nummularia was responsive to NaCl, but the mechanisms of this response are still not known. In such stress condition, Na+ and Cl- accumulation in leaves was far greater than that in roots; therefore salinity tolerance of Atriplex nummularia is not due to ion exclusion mechanism. In spite of a reduction of K+ content of tissues under salinity conditions, no corresponding physiological relevance of this in terms of growth was found. The high affinity of root cells for Na+ during uptake and, probably, its subsequent sequestration into cell vacuoles and structures of protection seems to contribute to osmotic adjustment as an increase in relative water content (RWC) of leaves was observed. NaCl caused a decrease in total soluble proteins and chlorophylls; the relevance of this is discussed in terms of mechanisms of salinity tolerance. The ability of Atriplex nummularia plants to keep Na+ and Cl- away from enzymes and cytosolic structures, together with an effective osmotic adjustment, is suggested as having a role in its tolerance to high salinity.</jats:p>",

Therefore, planning the extraction of individual plants from wild populations in a sustainable way is especially important in the case of annual species. We studied the environmental matrix and population dynamic of four Salicornia ramosissima populations growing at two elevations in salt pans under a Mediterranean climate. In elevated areas, S. ramosissima populations presented maximum plant densities of between 628–6288 plants m−2 that remained almost constant until fruiting. In contrast, populations in depressed zones presented five-times greater soil-seed-bank densities and maximum plant densities than populations in elevated zones. In this context, populations in depressed zones lost c. 60% of their maximum plant densities from the end of spring and through summer. In whatever way the environmental matrix seemed to control the population dynamic of S. ramosissima in depressed zones, the effects of a stressful environment would interact with plant densities. In this sense, we recorded the density-dependent mortality for the densest population (max. 51,558 plants m−2). Our results are useful for planning a sustainable harvesting of natural populations of S. ramosissima.</jats:p>",

Seed processing techniques aimed at improving seedling emergence have gained interest by pasture managers. The purpose of this study was to investigate the combined effects of bracteole removal and seeding rate on seedling emergence in seven halophytic species: Atriplex halimus, A. canescens, A. leucoclada, A. nummularia, A. lentiformis, Salsola vermiculata and Haloxylon aphyllum under semi-arid conditions in Tel Hadya (Syria). Each of these species was evaluated for seedling emergence under two seed treatments (bracteoles removed and non-removed bracteoles) with three seeding rates (10, 30 and 60 seeds per pot), in a completely randomised block design. The results showed a positive effect of seed treatment on seedling emergence for all studied species. The native A. halimus had the highest emergence percentages whereas the introduced A. mummularia, had the lowest. However, there were no significant effects of seeding rates on seedling emergence. These results showed that bracteole removal could improve germination and seedling emergence, and potentially increase the rate of establishment of the species studied. Therefore, when implementing rangeland rehabilitation projects, bracteole removal needs to be considered. The native S. vermiculata should be recommended for direct seeding in the West Asia and North Africa region given its high seedling emergence, known high palatability, nutritive value, and high auto-regeneration performance.</jats:p>",

The aim of this study was to investigate the biodiversity and structure of rhizobacterial communities associated with the halophyte S. marina from low and moderate sulfate–chloride salinity habitats. The bacterial community of bulk and rhizosphere soil was analyzed using high-throughput sequencing of the V1–V9 region of 16S rRNA by Oxford Nanopore Technologies. Alpha and beta diversity indices were calculated. A total of 55 phyla and 309 genera of bacteria were identified, among which Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes dominated. The occurrence of Planctomycetes, Verrucomicrobia, and Acidobacteria in the rhizosphere was higher than in the bulk soil. Bacterial alpha diversity in the bulk soil decreased with increasing salinity, while it increased in the rhizosphere. The proportion of the halotolerant bacteria of Flavobacterium and Alteromonas genera significantly grew with increasing salinity both in the bulk and rhizosphere soil. In addition, in the rhizosphere, the percentage of Comamonas, Methylibium, Lysobacter, Planctomyces, Sphingomonas, Stenotrophomonas, and Lewinella genera increased. Among them, several genera included plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR). In the more saline bulk soil, the proportion of halotolerant genera Bacillus, Salinimicrobium, Marinobacter, Clostridium, Euzebya, KSA1, Marinobacter, Clostridium, Salinimicrobium, and Halorhodospira was also higher compared to the low saline site. Thus, increasing the salinity changed the taxonomic structure of the bacterial communities of both bulk soil and rhizosphere.</jats:p>",

On the western coast of Ireland, habitats designated as Ombrogenic Atlantic salt marshes were formed on ombrogenic peat substrate. The peat substrate in these systems has three times more ammonium than substrate from adjacent salt marsh habitats on sand and mud substrate. This study examined the extent to which the high concentration of ammonium in peat salt marsh substrate influences the N‐ assimilating enzyme activity of halophytes and the extent to which N metabolism differs between species. Specifically, this work investigated whether plants from peat salt marshes are more likely to assimilate ammonium than plants from non‐peat substrates. Four halophyte plant species—<jats:italic>Armeria maritima, Aster tripolium, Plantago maritime,</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Triglochin maritime</jats:italic>—were sampled from various saltmarsh habitats including three sites on peat substrate and three on non‐peat substrate, comprising sand, mud and sand/mud. The activities of N‐metabolising enzymes—glutamine synthetase (GS), glutamate synthase, glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), and nitrate reductase (NR)—were quantified in shoot and root parts. Root GS activity in <jats:italic>Armeria maritima</jats:italic> and shoot GS activity in <jats:italic>Triglochin maritima</jats:italic> were positively correlated with increasing soil ammonium levels.

The shoot : root GS activity ratio in <jats:italic>Triglochin maritima</jats:italic> on peat substrate was more than double the ratio on non‐peat substrates.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Halophytes species can be used as a highly convenient model system to reveal key ionic and molecular mechanisms that confer salinity tolerance in plants. Earlier, we reported that quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.), a facultative C3 halophyte species, can efficiently control the activity of slow (SV) and fast (FV) tonoplast channels to match specific growth conditions by ensuring that most of accumulated Na+ is safely locked in the vacuole (Bonales-Alatorre et al. (2013) Plant Physiology). This work extends these finding by comparing the properties of tonoplast FV and SV channels in two quinoa genotypes contrasting in their salinity tolerance. The work is complemented by studies of the kinetics of net ion fluxes across the plasma membrane of quinoa leaf mesophyll tissue. Our results suggest that multiple mechanisms contribute towards genotypic differences in salinity tolerance in quinoa. These include: (i) a higher rate of Na+ exclusion from leaf mesophyll; (ii) maintenance of low cytosolic Na+ levels; (iii) better K+ retention in the leaf mesophyll; (iv) a high rate of H+ pumping, which increases the ability of mesophyll cells to restore their membrane potential; and (v) the ability to reduce the activity of SV and FV channels under saline conditions. These mechanisms appear to be highly orchestrated, thus enabling the remarkable overall salinity tolerance of quinoa species.</jats:p>",

The growth capacity of the bacteria was determined at different levels of pH and salinity, and several growth promotion characteristics were identified, such as phosphorus solubilization, indole acetic acid production by the tryptophan-dependent (AIAt) and tryptophan-independent (IAA) pathways, ammonium production from organic sources, solubilization of carbonates, and zinc and sodium capture capacity. In addition, the bacteria that presented the best characteristics for germination variables of Solanum lycopersicum were evaluated. A total of 20 bacteria from root soil of Sesuvium verrucosum Raf. belonging to the phyla Proteobacteria (50%), Firmicutes (45%) and Actinobacteria (5%) were identified, with each one having different morphological characteristics.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>A novel bacterial strain was isolated from the roots of Suaeda japonica, a halophytic plant inhabiting tidal zones. Phylogenetic, genomic, and phenotypic analyses identified the isolate as a novel species within the genus Paraburkholderia, for which the name Paraburkholderia suaedae sp. nov. is proposed. The strain exhibits multiple plant growth-promoting traits, including the production of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid, indole-3-acetic acid, and siderophore, along with the ability to fix nitrogen and solubilize phosphate. Genomic analysis revealed genes associated with enhanced root surface adhesion and rhizosphere survival, such as those involved in thiamine biosynthesis and transport, and biofilm formation via poly-β-1,6-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (PGA) synthesis. These features suggest the strain’s potential for persistent colonization and beneficial interaction with host plants. Although its direct impact on plant growth has not yet been experimentally validated, the genetic and biochemical evidence supports its potential application in agriculture. The objective of this study was to conduct a polyphasic taxonomic characterization of a novel strain DGU8T isolated from the roots of the halophyte Suaeda japonica, and to assess its potential as a plant growth-promoting agent, particularly its tolerance to drought-related osmotic stress.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Growing degree days (GDDs) and leaf area index (LAI) greatly influence the growth and yield of many crops grown in arid regions. Therefore, variation in LAI due to GDD can provide a theoretical basis for predicting crop growth, water consumption, plant development, and yield in arid agriculture via the development of mathematical growth models. This study described the relationship between plant biomass production and variation in LAI due to GDD in arid regions under different types of irrigation (fresh water and saline water) and soils amended with different substances (manure+sandy soil, compost+sandy soil, clay+sandy soil, and sandy soil). Mathematical models for LAI were established for GDDs. In addition, different water quality irrigation techniques were used as independent variables to calculate the LAI of halophytic plants (Hedysarum scoparium) in arid regions under different soil amendment treatments. Furthermore, mathematical models for plant biomass production were developed by using the LAI and GDDs. For this purpose, Logistic, Gaussian, modified Gaussian, and Cubic polynomial models were used. Modified Gaussian and Cubic polynomial models are the best among all developed models, but Cubic polynomial models are more suitable among all developed models because of their simple quadratic equations that can be solved by using the first derivative. It was observed that with increased salt concentration in the irrigation water, the growth of per plant production decreased. However, soil amendments like manure and compost enhance salt tolerance against salt stress and enable plants to sustain their growth. Furthermore, Hedysarum scoparium attains maximum LAI when its GDD is about 1117.5 °C under both irrigation regimes and in all soil amendment treatments. It was concluded that these predicted mathematical models can provide crucial insights for enhancing production in arid regions by using eco-friendly soil amendments to improve water use efficiency across diverse types of water irrigation.</jats:p>",

Therefore, this study aimed at establishing a micropropagation protocol for golden samphire that can serve as a nursery approach to its standardized commercial cultivation. For that purpose, a complete regeneration protocol was developed by improving shoot multiplication from nodal explants, rooting, and acclimatization methodologies. The treatment with BAP alone induced the maximum shoot formation (7–7.8 shoots/explant), while IAA treatment increased the shoot height (9.26–9.5 cm). Furthermore, the treatment that coupled best shoot multiplication (7.8 shoots/explant) and highest shoot height (7.58 cm) was MS medium supplemented with 0.25 mg/L BAP. Moreover, all shoots produced roots (100% rooting), and multiplication treatments did not exert significant effect on root length (7.8–9.7 cm/plantlet). Moreover, by the end of the rooting phase, plantlets cultivated with 0.25 mg/L BAP had the highest shoot number (4.2 shoots/plantlet), and plantlets from 0.6 mg/L IAA + 1 mg/L BAP presented the highest shoot height (14.2 cm) similar to control plantlets (14.0 cm). The survival up to the ex-vitro acclimatization stage was increased from 9.8% (control) to 83.3%, when plants were treated with a paraffin solution. Nevertheless, the in vitro multiplication of golden samphire is a promising way for its rapid propagation and can be used as a nursery method, contributing to the development of this species as an alternative food and medicinal crop.</jats:p>",

Several cis-acting elements, such as ABRE (ABA-responsive element), DRE-CRT (dehydration responsive-element/C-Repeat), LTRE (low temperature-responsive element), ERE (ethylene-responsive element), LRE (light-responsive element), etc. contributed at varying degrees to salt-, drought- and ABA-enhanced expression of gusA reporter gene in Arabidopsis thaliana under the full-length promoter, pAsr11875 and its deletion derivatives with an assortment of cis-regulatory motifs.

The results showed that plant height, number of branches, and biomass were significantly affected by water table and salt stress. With enhanced salt stress, the ratio of leaf to total biomass increased and the ratio of root to total biomass decreased. The contents of Chl‐a, ‐b, Chl‐a + b, and carotenoids (Car) decreased significantly with increasing soil salinity and the water table level. Salt stress enhanced the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), but reduced the content of protein. With the lowering water table level, the activity of CAT and protein content increased, and activity of SOD decreased. Na<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> and Cl<jats:sup>−</jats:sup> content were up‐regulated with increasing salt stress (NaCl), whereas, the contents of other cations (K<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>, Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>, and Mg<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>) and anions (<jats:styled-content>${\\rm SO}_{{\\rm 4}}^{{\\rm 2}- } $<jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/tex2gif-ueqn-1.gif\" xlink:title=\"equation image\" /></jats:styled-content> and <jats:styled-content>${\\rm NO}_{{\\rm 3}}^{- } $<jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/tex2gif-ueqn-2.gif\" xlink:title=\"equation image\" /></jats:styled-content>) were decreased.

While there is growing pharmacological interest in S. glauca, research on its secondary metabolites remains limited. In this study, chemical constituents of the aerial parts of S. glauca were identified using 1D- and 2D-NMR experiments, and its biological activity concerning hair loss was newly reported. Eight compounds, including alkaloids (1~3), flavonoids (4~6), and phenolics (7 and 8), were isolated. The compounds, except the flavonoids, were isolated for the first time from S. glauca. In the HPLC chromatogram, quercetin-3-O-β-d-glucoside, kaempferol-3-O-β-d-glucoside, and kaempferol were identified as major constituents in the extract of S. glauca. Additionally, the therapeutic potential of the extract of S. glauca and the isolated compounds 1~8 on the expressions of VEGF and IGF-1, as well as the regulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, were evaluated in human follicle dermal papilla cells (HFDPCs) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Among the eight compounds, compound 4 was the most potent in terms of increasing the expression of VEGF and IGF-1 and the regulation of Wnt/β-catenin. These findings suggest that S. glauca extract and its compounds are potential new candidates for preventing or treating hair loss.</jats:p>",

Halophytes improve saline alkali soil, and the halophyte transcription factors that regulate salt stress are crucial for improving salt tolerance. In this study, 1466 transcription factors were identified by transcriptome sequencing analysis of Glaux maritima leaves after salt stress (0, 600, and 800 mM/L NaCl). Their genes were distributed across 57 transcription factor families. KEGG and GO analyses showed significant enrichment in 14 pathways, with a total of 54 functions annotated. Gene expression analysis showed 820 differentially expressed genes distributed in 11 transcription factor families, including ERF, bHLH, WRKY, and NAC, and 8 expression modules. KEGG analysis revealed four genes with significant positive regulation: ABF2 (Unigene0078257) in the ABA signaling pathway, EIN3 (Unigene0000457 and Unigene0012139), and EIL1 (Unigene0042139) involved in ethylene signal transduction, and two with negative regulation, MYC1/2 (Unigene0009899 and Unigene0027167) in the main regulator of Jasmonic acid signal transduction. Protein–protein interaction networks suggested ABF2 and MYC1/2 as important transcription factors regulating G. maritima salt tolerance. Overall, the salt-tolerant transcription factors discovered in this study provide genetic resources for plant salt tolerance inheritance, and lay a theoretical foundation for the study of the salt-tolerant molecular mechanism of the halophyte Glaux maritima.</jats:p>",

However, only a few studies have assessed the combined effects of two or more environmental factors on C. quinoa. Here, we investigated the effects of salinity (300 mM NaCl), elevated temperature (35 °C), and their interaction with growth, water–salt balance, the efficiency of photosystem II (PSII), the activity of cyclic electron transport (CET) around photosystem I (PSI), Rubisco and PEPC enzyme content, and the expression of photosynthetic genes. We found that elevated temperature did not decrease the biomass but caused a significant increase in the water and potassium content of C. quinoa leaves. The decrease in PSII efficiency under elevated temperature was accompanied by an increase in the expression of genes encoding the components of PSII (psbA) and linear electron transport (FDI), as well as the main photosynthetic protein Rubisco (rbcL). Moreover, the strongest effect was induced by the combined effect of elevated temperature and salinity, which induced high oxidative stress (a threefold increase in MDA), a threefold decrease in the biomass, a twofold decrease in PSII efficiency, and a two- to eightfold decrease in the expression of the photosynthetic genes psbA, FDI, and rbcL. PSI was more tolerant to all forms of stress; however, the combined effect of elevated temperature and salinity downregulated the expression of PGR5 and FNR1, which may diminish the role of PGR5/PGRL1-dependent CET in favor of the NDH-dependent CET of PSI. The obtained data on the functioning of photosystems and the expression of photosynthetic genes under combined stress (elevated temperature and salinity) can make a significant contribution to understanding the mechanisms of tolerance of C. quinoa to multiple stresses under climate change conditions.</jats:p>",

A glasshouse experiment was designed to investigate the effect of this range of salinities on the morphology and the photosynthetic apparatus of <jats:italic>S. fruticosa</jats:italic> by measuring growth rate, photosynthetic and non‐photosynthetic area, atrophy of distal branch ends, water status, chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, gas exchange and photosynthetic pigment concentrations. The long‐term effects of salinity on the growth of <jats:italic>S. fruticosa</jats:italic> were mainly determined by the extent of photosynthetic area rather than the variations in net photosynthetic rate. Photosynthetic area was reduced at 1030 m<jats:italic>M</jats:italic> as a result of a decrease in the length of the photosynthetic portions. This was induced by fewer internodes and, at salinities lower than 510 m<jats:italic>M</jats:italic>, smaller internode diameter.

This work evaluated different extraction methods and the composition of total esterified fatty acids in a meal of ground fertile shoots of S. ambigua, seeking for an alternative primary matter and larger yield of total lipids. The highest lipid yield was obtained with a chloroform:methanol mixture (2:1)(v/v) (5.2% of dry weight).

The fine‐textured ecotype is diploid and appears to reproduce in the wild both sexually and by clonal propagation; in contrast, the coarse‐textured ecotype consists largely of clonally‐propagating triploid and diploid genotypes.

These features indicate the high phytoremediation capabilities of these halophyte plants. The excretion of multi-ionic solutes by the salt glands results in the appearance of tiny crystals on the surface of the leaves. In this publication, for the first time, an attempt was made to determine what chemical compounds build up these crystals and to determine their crystal structure.

This study endeavoured to evaluate the inhibitory potential of leaves, roots, twigs and fruits extracts (decoction and maceration) of B. gymnorhiza against key enzymes relevant to diabetes. Considering complications related to diabetes, other clinical enzymes, namely, acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), tyrosinase, elastase and pancreatic lipase, were used. Identification of compounds was carried out using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS). Antioxidant capacities were assessed using DPPH, ABTS, FRAP, CUPRAC, phosphomolybdenum, metal chelating. The relationship between mode of extraction, plant parts and biological activities was determined using multivariate analysis. Macerated fruits, rich in phytochemicals (phenolic, flavanol, tannin, and triterpenoid), exhibited substantially high antioxidant capacities related to radical scavenging (DPPH: 547.75 ± 10.99 and ABTS: 439.59 ± 19.13 mg TE/g, respectively) and reducing potential (CUPRAC: 956.04 ± 11.90 and FRAP: 577.26 ± 4.55 mg TE/g, respectively). Additionally, the same extract significantly depressed AChE and BChE (3.75 ± 0.03 and 2.19 ± 0.13 mg GALAE/g, respectively), tyrosinase (147.01 ± 0.78 mg KAE/g), elastase (3.14 ± 0.08 mg OE/g) and amylase (1.22 ± 0.01 mmol ACAE/g) enzymatic activities. Phytochemical results confirmed the presence of 119 compounds in all maceration and 163 compounds in all decoction samples. The screening also revealed important compounds in the extracts, namely, quinic acid, brugierol, bruguierol A, epigallocatechin, chlorogenic acid, to name a few. Multivariate analysis reported that the plant parts of B. gymnorhiza greatly influenced the observed biological activities in contrast to the types of extraction methods employed. Docking calculations have supported the findings of the experimental part through the high binding affinity and strong interactions of some compounds against tyrosinase, AChE, BChE and elastase enzymes. The decocted root and leaf of B. gymnorhiza showed low to moderate antidiabetic activity, thereby partially supporting its traditional uses in the management of diabetes. However, the fruit, the most active organ, can be used as a diet supplement to reduce the risk of diabetes complications after evaluating its cytotoxic effects.</jats:p>",

Since the shoots can be eaten raw, the objective of the present study was to investigate possible controls on the abundance of human pathogenic microorganisms (HPMOs) in the shoots as a health risk. For this reason, the molecular-chemical composition of shoots, site-specific soil organic matter (bulk and rhizosphere), and soil pH and salinity were analyzed. Plant and soil samples were taken from two test sites with differing salinity levels in France (a young and an old marsh). We hypothesized that the chemical traits of plants and soils could suppress or promote HPMOs and, thus, serve as risk indicators for food quality. The chemical traits of shoots and bulk and rhizosphere soil were measured through thermochemolysis using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The densities of cultivable HPMOs (Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli, and Listeria monocytogenes) were determined in plant shoots, rhizosphere soil, and bulk soil using selective media. Negative correlations between lignin content in the shoots and the abundance of S. enterica, as well as between lignin content in bulk soil and the abundance of E. coli, are explained by the lignin-based rigidity and its protective effect on the cell wall. In the shoot samples, the content of lipids was positively correlated with the abundance of E. coli. The abundance of E. coli, S. enterica, and L. monocytogenes in bulk soil decreased with increasing soil pH, which is linked to increased salinity. Therefore, soil salinity is proposed as a tool to decrease HPMO contamination in S. europaea and ensure its food safety.</jats:p>",

Expression studies using the 3′‐untranslated region of the <jats:italic>Vmac1</jats:italic> cDNA as a probe showed that the corresponding salt‐inducible transcript was preferentially expressed in leaves. Induction by salt was also observed in juvenile plants in addition to adult ones. These findings, as well as the inability of mannitol to upregulate mRNA levels for this gene, clearly differentiate between the induction of transcript for the V‐ATPase c subunit and for genes involved in the CAM pathway in <jats:italic>M. crystallinum</jats:italic>. Further, the plant growth regulator abscisic acid (ABA) was able to mimic the effect of salt on transcript levels for the V‐ATPase c subunit, suggesting the possible involvement of ABA in a distinct signal‐transduction pathway linked to vacuolar salt accumulation in this highly salt‐tolerant species.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Recent advances in deep learning (DL) and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technologies have made it possible to monitor salt marshes more efficiently and precisely. However, studies have rarely compared the classification performance of DL with the pixel-based method for coastal wetland monitoring using UAV data. In particular, many studies have been conducted at the landscape level; however, little is known about the performance of species discrimination in very small patches and in mixed vegetation. We constructed a dataset based on UAV-RGB data and compared the performance of pixel-based and DL methods for five scenarios (combinations of annotation type and patch size) in the classification of salt marsh vegetation. Maximum likelihood, a pixel-based classification method, showed the lowest overall accuracy of 73%, whereas the U-Net classification method achieved over 90% accuracy in all classification scenarios. As expected, in a comparison of pixel-based and DL methods, the DL approach achieved the most accurate classification results. Unexpectedly, there was no significant difference in overall accuracy between the two annotation types and labeling data sizes in this study. However, when comparing the classification results in detail, we confirmed that polygon-type annotation was more effective for mixed-vegetation classification than the bounding-box type. Moreover, the smaller size of labeling data was more effective for detecting small vegetation patches. Our results suggest that a combination of UAV-RGB data and DL can facilitate the accurate mapping of coastal salt marsh vegetation at the local scale.</jats:p>",

However, the effect and related mechanisms of flue-cured tobacco leaves on the product quality, phytotoxicity and bacterially-mediated nitrogen (N) transformation process of tail vegetable composting were poorly understood. Amendments of high-dosed (5% and 10% w/w) tobacco leaves into the compost accelerated the heating process, prolonged the time of thermophilic stage, increased the peak temperature, thereby improving maturity and shortening composting duration. The tobacco leaf amendments at the 10% (w/w) increased the N conservation (TN and NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>-N content) of compost, due to the supply of N-containing nutrient and promotion of organic matter degradation by tobacco leaves. Besides, tobacco leaf amendments promoted the seed germination and root development of wild soybean, exhibiting the feasibility of composting product for promoting the growth of salt-tolerant plants, but no dose-dependent effect was found for tobacco leaf amendments. Addition of high dosed (5% and 10% w/w) tobacco leaves shifted the bacterial community towards lignocellulosic and N-fixing bacteria, contributing to increasing the compost maturity and N retention. PICRUSt 2 functional prediction revealed that N-related bacterial metabolism (i.e., hydroxylamine oxidation and denitrifying process) was enhanced in the tobacco leaf treatments, which contributed to N retention and elevated nutrient quality of composting. To the best knowledge, this was the first study to explore the effect of tobacco waste additives on the nutrient transformation and halophyte growth promotion of organic waste composting. These findings will deepen the understanding of microbially-mediated N transformation and composting processes involving flue-cured tobacco leaves.</jats:p>",

The marine halophyte a was collected, washed and chopped into 5cm long parts and shade dried for 20 – 25 days in a dark room. The dehydrated and bleached plant material was subjected to Soxhlet extraction. Two solvents, viz methanol and ethyl acetate, were used to prepare decoction. The extracts were dried using rotary vacuum evaporator. chemical screening by GC-MS unveiled the presence of 32 compounds in ethyl acetate and 29 in methanol. The 3D structures of the phytochemicals were retrieved from Pub Chem. Cytotoxic study showed promising results. The IC50 values of the individual extracts were evaluated and ethyl acetate extract exhibit minimum IC50 value and it was estimated to be 97.9μg/mL wereas methanol extract exhibit a minimum IC50 value of 117.1μg/mL. Hence, the study concludes that S. europaea L. provides a promising source of lead compounds that could be exploited in near future to treat cancer.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: IMTA is an integrated and eco-friendly farming approach, where organisms from different trophic levels can be cultured in the same system to take advantage of the synergistic interaction between species. Methods: The experiment was conducted in earthen ponds for four months to investigate the effect of bivalves (M. casta) in halophyte-based IMTA on water quality, growth performance and microbial load. Shrimp and fish were fed with commercial feed containing 35% and 30% crude protein, respectively. Result: The total ammonia nitrogen, nitrate-nitrogen and nitrite were comparatively low in treatments, T1 (0.13±0.012, 0.013±0.003 and 0.45±0.01, respectively) and T2 (0.15±0.005, 0.017±0.003 and 0.50±0.01, respectively). Similarly, the better average body weight, specific growth rate and feed conversion ratio were found in treatments, T1 (Shrimp: 33.87±0.88 g, 6.20±0.01% 1.10±0.02 respectively, Fish: 94.18±0.08 g, 1.59±0.001% and 1.60±0.006 respectively) and T2 (Shrimp: 32.37±0.60 g, 6.16±0.02% and 1.15±0.02 respectively fish: 92.91±0.2 g, 1.59±0.009 and 1.63±0.08 respectively). Therefore it can be concluded that the use of bivalves helps to create better water quality for the growth and survival of P. vannamei and M. cephalus in halophyte-based integrated multi-trophic aquaculture. </jats:p>",

The increased concentration of heavy metals in soil led to increases in heavy metal shoot and root concentrations of Ni, Cu, Pb and Zn in plants as compared to those grown on unpolluted soil. Accumulation was higher in roots than shoots for all the heavy metals. None of the plants were suitable for phytoextraction because no hyperaccumulator was identified.

Additionally, we tested the ability of non-germinated seeds that had been exposed to different concentrations of NaCl to recover their germination in distilled water. The results showed a significant effect of seed source, temperature, and salinity, and some of their two- and three-way interactions on final germination and recovery percentage. The seeds from non-saline provenances had the highest percentages for germination (ca. 79%) under the 35/25 °C temperature regime, whereas the lowest percentages for germination (ca. 21%) was recorded for seeds from saline conditions under the 25/15 °C treatment. Additionally, percent germination was significantly lower for the seeds incubated in the saline solutions (100, 200, 400, and 600 mmol/L NaCl) and germinated under colder conditions (15/25 °C), compared with the seeds incubated in non-saline solutions (control group, 0 mmol/L NaCl) and germinated under warmer conditions (35/25 °C). The highest recovery percentage was recorded for seeds of the hyper-saline habitat incubated at 35/25 °C. Thus, seeds maintained their viability despite experiencing a range of saline conditions and were able to germinate upon the arrival of suitable conditions, which can be an adaptation to its saline arid desert habitat. </jats:p>",

We predicted a total of 50,562 protein‐coding genes, of which a significant fraction was found to be involved in secondary metabolite biosynthesis and hormone signal transduction pathways. Several salinity and submergence stress‐responsive protein‐coding and long noncoding RNAs involved in diverse biological processes were identified using RNA‐sequencing data.

Here, a hydromethanolic extract of Crithmum maritimum (L.) leaves was fractionated, and the fractions were evaluated in vitro for antioxidant (using DPPH, ABTS, and FRAP bioassays), anti-inflammatory (inhibition of NO production in RAW 264.7 macrophages), antidiabetic (alpha-glucosidase inhibition), neuroprotective (inhibition of acetylcholinesterase), and skin-protective (tyrosinase and melanogenesis inhibitions) activities. Polar fractions of the extract were rich in phenolics and, correlatively, displayed a strong antioxidant power. Moreover, fractions eluted with MeOH20 and MeOH80 exhibited a marked inhibition of alpha-glucosidase (IC50 = 0.02 and 0.04 mg/mL, respectively), MeOH60 fractions showed a strong capacity to reduce NO production in macrophages (IC50 = 6.4 μg/mL), and MeOH80 and MeOH100 fractions had strong anti-tyrosinase activities (630 mgKAE/gDW). NMR analyses revealed the predominance of chlorogenic acid in MeOH20 fractions, 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid in MeOH40 fractions, and 3-O-rutinoside, 3-O-glucoside, 3-O-galactoside, and 3-O-robinobioside derivatives of quercetin in MeOH60 fractions. These compounds likely account for the strong antidiabetic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties of sea-fennel polar extract, respectively. Overall, our results make sea fennel a valuable source of medicinal or nutraceutical agents to prevent diabetes, inflammation processes, and oxidative damage.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The possibility of simultaneous production of halophyte and euryhaline fish creates huge interest in both commercial aquaponics systems and in research. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of three different salinities (8, 14, and 20 ppt) on the growth performance and survival rate of sea bream (Sparus aurata) and rock samphire (Crithmum maritimum) in an experimental brackish aquaponic system. Furthermore, induction of heat shock proteins (Hsps) and phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) were assessed through the sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and immunoblot analysis. A total number of 234 sea bream individuals were divided into nine autonomous aquaponic systems. The experiment lasted 45 days. In total, 54 individuals of rock samphire were used and were distributed into groups of six individuals per hydroponic tank using the raft method. Water quality showed stable fluctuation throughout the experiment, strongly supporting fish and plant growth performance and survival in both treatments. The results show that better growth performance for both sea bream and rock samphire (height increase) was evident in salinity 8 ppt compared to salinities 14 ppt and 20 ppt. Minimal or mild histopathological alterations were detected in gills, midgut, and liver for all three salinity groups. Exposure to different salinities modified Hsp60 and MAPKs expression in a tissue- and time-specific manner. During exposure to 8 ppt, constant Hsp60 levels and phosphorylation of MAPKs at 15 days may indicate a prominent protective role in the gills. The results show that sea bream and rock samphire can be used in brackish aquaponics systems with satisfactory growth performances, thus allowing for a range of commercial applications generating interest in their production.</jats:p>",

Here, we report ecophysiological and proteomic data about (1) the effect of high salt (200 mM NaCl) on the early developmental stages (germination and seedling) and (2) the seed germination recovery capacity of this species. Upon salt exposure, seed germination was severely inhibited and delayed and seedling length was restricted. Interestingly, non‐germinated seeds remained viable, showing high germination percentage and faster germination than the control seeds after their transfer onto distilled water. The plant phenotypic plasticity during germination was better highlighted by the proteomic data. Salt exposure triggered (1) a marked slower degradation of seed storage reserves and (2) a significant lower abundance of proteins involved in several biological processes (primary metabolism, energy, stress‐response, folding and stability). Yet, these proteins showed strong increased abundance early after stress release, thereby sustaining the faster seed storage proteins mobilization under recovery conditions compared to the control. Overall, as part of the plant survival strategy, <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\"><jats:italic>C. maritima</jats:italic></jats:styled-content> seems to avoid germination and establishment under high salinity.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Although various studies have investigated osmoadaptations of halophilic fungi to saline conditions, only few analyzed the fungal mechanisms occurring at saturated NaCl concentrations. Halophilic <jats:italic>Aspergillus sydowii</jats:italic> is a model organism for the study of molecular adaptations of filamentous fungi to hyperosmolarity. For the first time a multi-omics approach (i.e., transcriptomics and metabolomics) was used to compare <jats:italic>A. sydowii</jats:italic> at saturated concentration (5.13 M NaCl) to optimal salinity (1 M NaCl). Analysis revealed 1,842 genes differentially expressed of which 704 were overexpressed. Most differentially expressed genes were involved in metabolism and signal transduction. A gene ontology multi-scale network showed that ATP binding constituted the main network node with direct interactions to phosphorelay signal transduction, polysaccharide metabolism, and transferase activity. Free amino acids significantly decreased and amino acid metabolism was reprogrammed at 5.13 M NaCl. mRNA transcriptional analysis revealed upregulation of genes involved in methionine and cysteine biosynthesis at extreme water deprivation by NaCl. No modifications of membrane fatty acid composition occurred. Upregulated genes were involved in high-osmolarity glycerol signal transduction pathways, biosynthesis of β-1,3-glucans, and cross-membrane ion transporters. Downregulated genes were related to the synthesis of chitin, mannose, cell wall proteins, starvation, pheromone synthesis, and cell cycle. Non-coding RNAs represented the 20% of the total transcripts with 7% classified as long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). The 42% and 69% of the total lncRNAs and RNAs encoding transcription factors, respectively, were differentially expressed. A network analysis showed that differentially expressed lncRNAs and RNAs coding transcriptional factors were mainly related to the regulation of metabolic processes, protein phosphorylation, protein kinase activity, and plasma membrane composition. Metabolomic analyses revealed more complex and unknown metabolites at saturated NaCl concentration than at optimal salinity. This study is the first attempt to unravel the molecular ecology of an ascomycetous fungus at extreme water deprivation by NaCl (5.13 M). This work also represents a pioneer study to investigate the importance of lncRNAs and transcriptional factors in the transcriptomic response to high NaCl stress in halophilic fungi.</jats:p>",

An experiment was designed to study the response of the halophyte Atriplex halimus to a range of salinities and different concentrations of Cd and Ni. Tolerance and soil remedial potential of the plant were quantified in terms of PTE uptake and portioning, plant biomass, root/shoot ratio, chlorophyll and anti-oxidative enzyme production, along with stress markers such as lipid peroxidation, proline, and glycine betaine. The plant was also evaluated for its potential to phytoremediate PTE contaminated soil. The results suggest that A. halimus can tolerate moderate concentrations of both the PTEs and salt.

Photosynthetic pigment and total reduced nitrogen concentrations were significantly higher in purslane grown in 10% ASW than in 40% ASW. However, LED spectral quality did not markedly influence these parameters. Grown in 10% ASW under R/B 2.2, purslane had the highest maximum nitrate reductase activity, while those in 40% ASW under R/B 2.2 had the highest activation state. Under both light qualities, purslane had a sevenfold increase in proline concentration in 40% ASW than in 10% ASW. Total phenolic compounds’ concentration was the highest in 10% ASW under R/B 0.9, while there were no significant differences in the accumulation of total soluble sugars and ascorbic acids among all plants. Antioxidant enzymes activities were lower in 40% ASW under R/B 2.2 compared to the other conditions. In conclusion, salinity affected the yield, physiology and nutritional quality of purslane. The impacts of LED spectral quality on purslane were only reflected by certain physiological and nutritional parameters.</jats:p>",

This study is the first to investigate the tolerance and physiological response mechanism of Suaeda liaotungensis seedlings to heavy metal stress. The results exhibited that the toxicity degree of Pb, Cd, Cu, and Zn to Suaeda liaotungensis seedlings was highest for Cd and lowest for Pb. Heavy metal stress increased H2O2 levels in seedlings, thereby aggravating lipid peroxidation of the cell membrane and consequently increasing MDA content. Meanwhile, the SOD and CAT activities in seedlings increased under heavy metal stress, whereas POD activity decreased consistently under Cd and Zn stress. The soluble sugars and proline content in seedlings also showed an increasing trend under heavy metal stress. Furthermore, the tolerance in the seedlings from black seeds to Pb and Cd stress was improved by enhancing SOD and CAT activities and accumulating proline. However, the tolerance in the seedlings from brown seeds to Cu stress was improved by increasing CAT activity as well as accumulating soluble sugar and proline content.

Na and Cl accumulated to the highest levels in xylem parenchyma and epidermal cells, but were maintained at lower concentrations in photosynthetically active mesophyll and bundle sheath cells. Concentrations of Na and Cl in chloroplasts of mesophyll and bundle sheath cells were lower than in their respective vacuoles. No ultrastructural changes were observed in either mesophyll or bundle sheath chloroplasts, and photosynthetic activity was maintained in saline conditions. Salinity tolerance in Rhodes grass is related to specific cellular Na and Cl distributions in leaf tissues, and the ability to regulate Na and Cl concentrations in chloroplasts.</jats:p>",

Ice plant seedlings display moderate salt tolerance, with root growth unaffected by 200 mM NaCl treatments, though hypocotyl elongation is hindered in salt-stressed etiolated seedlings. Superoxide anion accumulation was prominent in cotyledons and primary leaves but decreased in root tissues over time, with no significant effect from salt treatment. Hydrogen peroxide levels initially surged in both control and salt-treated seedlings, with higher and more persistent accumulation in the salt-treated seedlings. The activities of H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>-scavenging ascorbate-glutathione cycle enzymes ascorbate peroxidase (APX), monodehydroascorbate reductase, and dehydroascorbate reductase increased, while guaiacol-dependent peroxidase activity decreased and catalase activity showed no change, indicating APX activity as the primary response to salt stress. Salt-induced APX activities were detected mainly in the microsomal fraction for light-grown seedlings and the cytosolic fraction for etiolated seedlings, highlighting plastids as the primary site of ROS accumulation under salt stress. An RNA-seq analysis of etiolated seedlings revealed about 8% unigenes showing more than a four-fold change in expression after a 6-h 200 mM NaCl treatment. GO enrichment analysis indicated that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with increased transcript abundance were associated with ion transport, antioxidant activity, and stress responses, while DEGs with decreased transcript abundance were linked to metabolic and biosynthesis processes such as ribosomal protein synthesis and cell wall formation. This indicates that salt stress hinders growth but enhances ion homeostasis and stress response mechanisms. The expression of all eight <jats:italic>APX</jats:italic> genes were induced by a 48-hour salt treatment, with varying expression patterns. For class III peroxidase family, 14 out of 53 identified unigenes qualified as DEGs.

These findings highlight the distinct roles of class III peroxidases in balancing plant growth and stress responses, advancing our understanding of the mechanisms behind salt tolerance in halophytes. This study comprehensively analyzed changes in gene expression, antioxidant enzyme activity, and ROS accumulation in ice plant seedlings. Unveiling these responses will advance our understanding of the growth–stress balance in the intrinsic salt tolerance in halophytes.</jats:p>",

In the halophyte Nitraria sibirica, which thrives in saline soils, we identified 19 CDPK genes (NsCDPKs) and classified them into four canonical angiosperm clades, highlighting conserved functional modules. Promoter analysis revealed diverse cis-acting elements responsive to light, hormones (ABA, MeJA, auxin, GA, SA), and abiotic stresses (drought, cold, wounding), along with numerous MYB binding sites, suggesting complex transcriptional regulation. Transcriptome profiling under salt stress (100 and 400 mM NaCl) showed induction of most NsCDPKs, with several genes significantly upregulated in roots and stems, indicating coordinated whole-plant activation. These salt-responsive NsCDPKs were also upregulated by cold but repressed under PEG-simulated drought, indicating stress-specific regulatory patterns. Fifteen MYB transcription factors, differentially expressed under salt stress, were predicted to interact with NsCDPK promoters, implicating them as upstream regulators. This study identified a potential salt- and cold-responsive CDPK regulatory module and a MYB-mediated transcriptional hierarchy in N. sibirica, providing insights into the molecular mechanisms of salinity adaptation and highlighting candidate genes that could be explored for improving salt tolerance in crop species.</jats:p>",

Of 91 detected metabolites, more than half were significantly affected by salinity. Removal of EBC dramatically modified these metabolic changes, with the biggest differences reported for gamma‐aminobutyric acid (GABA), proline, sucrose and inositol, affecting ion transport across cellular membranes (as shown in electrophysiological experiments).

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Many heavy metals are essential for metabolic processes, but are toxic at elevated levels. Metal tolerance proteins provide resistance to this toxicity. In this study, we identified and characterized a heavy metal-associated protein, AcHMA1, from the halophyte,  Atriplex canescens. Sequence analysis has revealed that AcHMA1 contains two heavy metal binding domains. Treatments with metals (Fe, Cu, Ni, Cd or Pb), PEG6000 and NaHCO3 highly induced AcHMA1 expression in A. canescens, whereas NaCl and low temperature decreased its expression. The role of AcHMA1 in metal stress tolerance was examined using a yeast expression system. Expression of the AcHMA1 gene significantly increased the ability of yeast cells to adapt to and recover from exposure to excess iron. AcHMA1 expression also provided salt, alkaline, osmotic and oxidant stress tolerance in yeast cells. Finally, subcellular localization of an AcHMA1/GFP fusion protein expressed in tobacco cells showed that AcHMA1 was localized in the plasma membrane. Thus, our results suggest that AcHMA1 encodes a membrane-localized metal tolerance protein that mediates the detoxification of iron in eukaryotes. Furthermore, AcHMA1 also participates in the response to abiotic stress.</jats:p>",

However, if ice plants are used to phytoremediate salinity soil, there are problems of slow initial growth, and a long period before active NaCl uptake occurs under higher salinity conditions. Application of endophytic bacteria may improve the problem, but there remain gaps in our understanding of how endophytic bacteria affect the growth and the biochemical and physiological characteristics of ice plants. The aims of this study were to identify growth-promoting endophytic bacteria from the roots of ice plants and to document the metabolomic response of ice plants after application of selected endophytic bacteria. Two plant growth-promoting endophytic bacteria were selected on the basis of their ability to promote ice plant growth. The two strains putatively identified as Microbacterium spp. and Streptomyces spp. significantly promoted ice plant growth, at 2-times and 2.5-times, respectively, compared with the control and also affected the metabolome of ice plants. The strain of Microbacterium spp. resulted in increased contents of metabolites related to the tricarboxylic acid cycle and photosynthesis. The effects of salt stress were alleviated in ice plants inoculated with the endobacterial strains, compared with uninoculated plants. A deeper understanding of the complex interplay among plant metabolites will be useful for developing microbe-assisted soil phytoremediation strategies, using Mesembryanthemum species.</jats:p>",

It was accompanied by an increase in transpiration and Rubisco and PEPC contents, while the Na<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> and proline contents were low in <jats:italic>K. prostrata</jats:italic> shoots. By the 10th day of salinity, Na<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> and proline have accumulated; PS I function has stabilized, while PS II efficiency has decreased due to the enhanced non-photochemical quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence (NPQ). Thus, under low salinity conditions, Na<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> accumulated slowly and the imbalance between light and dark reactions of photosynthesis was observed. These processes might be induced by an early sodium signaling wave that affects cellular pH and ion homeostasis, ultimately disturbing photosynthetic electron transport. Another adaptive reaction more “typical” of salt-tolerant species was observed at 200 mM NaCl treatment. It proceeds in two stages. First, during the first 4 days, dry biomass and apparent photosynthesis decrease, whereas stomata sensitivity and dissipation energy during dark respiration increase. In parallel, an active Na<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> accumulation and a decreased K<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>/Na<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> ratio take place. Second, by the 10th day, a fully-fledged adaptive response was formed, when growth and apparent photosynthesis stabilized and stomata closed. Decreased dissipation energy, increased WUE, stabilization of Rubisco and PEPC contents, and decreased proline content testify to the completion of the adaptation and stabilization of the physiological state of plants. The obtained results allowed us to conclude that the formation of a full-fledged salt-tolerant response common for halophytes in <jats:italic>K. prostrata</jats:italic> occurs by the 10th day of moderate salinity.</jats:p>",

This chapter explores the impact of cultivation in association with halophytes on the salt tolerance of Rosmarinus officinalis, a glycophyte plant.

However, association with halophytes significantly improved morphological and physiological parameters by regulating cell hydration, increasing proline concentration, total sugars, and maintaining photosynthesis. The results suggest that this agroecological approach, by integrating salt-tolerant plants, could be a viable solution for enhancing crop resilience in the face of soil salinization and extreme climatic conditions.

(creta trefoil, Fabaceae) belongs to a family and genus containing several medicinal species, and is considered a promising crop for saline Mediterranean areas. However, to the best of our knowledge, information regarding the biological properties of this species that could increase its biotechnological value is particularly scarce. Objectives: We aimed to evaluate the potential use of creta trefoil collected in Southern Portugal (Algarve) as a source of bioactive products. Methods: Food-grade extracts (water, acetone, ethanol) were obtained by ultrasound-assisted extraction from aerial parts (stems and leaves) and fruits (pods), and evaluated for acute toxicity on mammalian cells. In vitro enzymatic inhibition was appraised on enzymes related to neurodegeneration (acetyl- and butyryl-cholinesterase: AChE and BuChE), type-2 diabetes (T2DM, α-glucosidase, and α-amylase), and hyperpigmentation/food browning (tyrosinase). In vitro, antioxidant activity included radical scavenging towards 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2’-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS), ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), and metal chelating activity on iron and copper. Chemical composition was established by liquid chromatography coupled with a diode array detector (LC-DAD-ESI-MS/MS). Results: Samples were not toxic and were active towards AChE (especially acetone extracts) and BuChE (particularly ethanol and acetone fruits’ extracts). Acetone and water fruit extracts and ethanol extract from aerial organs displayed significant inhibition on α-glucosidase, but low capacity towards amylase. All extracts exhibited a high capacity to inhibit tyrosinase, except water extract from aerial organs. Fruit extracts had, in general, the highest antioxidant capacity, especially ethanol. Fruits exhibited the highest diversity of polyphenols, especially flavonols, catechins, quercetin, myricetin, and its derivatives. Conclusions: Overall, our results suggested that creta trefoil should be further explored as a source of natural products for the management of T2DM, hyperpigmentation disorders, or food additive to prevent food oxidation and browning.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Owing to their sessile nature, plants have developed a tapestry of molecular and physiological mechanisms to overcome diverse environmental challenges, including abiotic stresses. Adaptive radiation in certain lineages, such as Aizoaceae, enable their success in colonizing arid regions and is driven by evolutionary selection. Sesuvium verrucosum (commonly known as Western sea-purslane) is a highly salt-tolerant succulent halophyte belonging to the Aizoaceae family; thus, it provides us with the model-platform for studying plant adaptation to salt stress. Various transcriptional and translational mechanisms are employed by plants to cope with salt stress. One of the systems, namely, ubiquitin-mediated post-translational modification, plays a vital role in plant tolerance to abiotic stress and other biological process. E3 ligase plays a central role in target recognition and protein specificity in ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation. Here, we characterize E3 ligases in Sesuvium verrucosum from transcriptome analysis of roots in response to salinity stress. Our de novo transcriptome assembly results in 131,454 transcripts, and the completeness of transcriptome was confirmed by BUSCO analysis (99.3% of predicted plant-specific ortholog genes). Positive selection analysis shows 101 gene families under selection; these families are enriched for abiotic stress (e.g., osmotic and salt) responses and proteasomal ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic processes. In total, 433 E3 ligase transcripts were identified in S. verrucosum; among these transcripts, single RING-type classes were more abundant compared to multi-subunit RING-type E3 ligases. Additionally, we compared the number of single RING-finger E3 ligases with ten different plant species, which confirmed the abundance of single RING-type E3 ligases in different plant species. In addition, differential expression analysis showed significant changes in 13 single RING-type E3 ligases (p-value &lt; 0.05) under salinity stress. Furthermore, the functions of the selected E3 ligases genes (12 genes) were confirmed by yeast assay. Among them, nine genes conferred salt tolerance in transgenic yeast. This functional assay supports the possible involvement of these E3 ligase in salinity stress. Our results lay a foundation for translational research in glycophytes to develop stress tolerant crops.</jats:p>",

In this study, alterations in key molecular species from different lipid classes highlighted an increase in phospholipid species, particularly those from phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidic acid (PA), where the latter is central to the synthesis of membrane lipids. Triacylglycerol (TG) species decreased during salinity, while there was little change in plastidic galactolipids. EBC transcriptomic and proteomic data mining revealed changes in genes and proteins involved in lipid metabolism and the upregulation of transcripts for PIPKIB, PI5PII, PIPKIII, and phospholipase D delta suggested the induction of signalling processes mediated by phosphoinositides and PA. TEM and flow cytometry showed the dynamic nature of lipid droplets in these cells under salt stress. Altogether, this work indicates that the metabolism of TG might play an important role in EBC response to salinity as either an energy reserve for sodium accumulation and/or driving membrane biosynthesis for EBC expansion.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Soil salinization and desertification due to climate change are the most relevant challenges for the agriculture of the 21st century. Soil compost amendment and plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGP-R) are valuable tools to mitigate salinization and desertification impacts on agricultural soils. Selection of novel halo/thermo-tolerant bacteria from the rhizosphere of glicophytes and halophytes, grown on soil compost amended and watered with 150/300 mM NaCl, was the main objective of our study. Beneficial effects on the biomass, well-being and resilience, exerted on the assayed crops (maize, tomato, sunflower and quinoa), were clearly observable when soils were amended with 20% compost despite the very high soil electric conductivity (EC). Soil compost amendment not only was able to increase crop growth and biomass, but also their resilience to the stress caused by very high soil EC (up to 20 dS m−1). Moreover, compost amendment has proved itself a valuable source of highly halo-(4.0 M NaCl)/thermo tolerant rhizobacteria (55 °C), showing typical PGP features. Among the 13 rhizobacterial isolates, molecularly and biochemically characterized, two bacterial strains showed several biochemical PGP features. The use of compost is growing all around the world reducing considerably for farmers soil fertilization costs. In fact, only in Italy its utilization has ensured, in the last years, a saving of 650 million euro for the farmers, without taking into account the environment and human health benefits. Furthermore, the isolation of halo/thermo-tolerant PGPR strains and their use will allow the recovery and cultivation of hundreds of thousands of hectares of saline and arid soils now unproductive, making agriculture more respectful of agro-ecosystems also in view of upcoming climate change.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The objective of the study is to evaluate the chemical characterisation, and biological and in silico potential of Haloxylon stocksii (Boiss.) Benth, an important halophyte commonly used in traditional medicine. The research focuses on the roots and aerial parts of the plant and extracts them using two solvents: methanol and dichloromethane. Chemical characterisation of the extracts was carried out using total phenolic contents quantification, GC-MS analysis, and LC-MS screening. The results exhibited that the aerial parts of the plant have significantly higher total phenolic content than the roots. The GC-MS and LC-MS analysis of the plant extracts revealed the identification of 18 bioactive compounds in each. The biological evaluation was performed using antioxidant, antibacterial, and in vitro antidiabetic assays. The results exhibited that the aerial parts of the plant have higher antioxidant and in vitro antidiabetic activity than the roots. Additionally, the aerial parts of the plant were most effective against Gram-positive bacteria. Molecular docking was done to evaluate the binding affinity (BA) of the bioactive compounds characterised by GC-MS with diabetic enzymes used in the in vitro assay. The results showed that the BA of γ-sitosterol was better than that of acarbose, which is used as a standard in the in vitro assay. Overall, this study suggests that the extract from aerial parts of H. stocksii using methanol as a solvent have better potential as a new medicinal plant and can provide a new aspect to develop more potent medications. The research findings contribute to the scientific data of the medicinal properties of Haloxylon stocksii and provide a basis for further evaluation of its potential as a natural remedy.</jats:p>",

The ice plant extract showed good antioxidant activity measured by DPPH, ORAC, TEAC, FRAP and ferrous ion chelating activity. Moreover, the extract showed potent ACE, DPP-IV and PEP-inhibitory activity (90.5%, 98.6% and 73.1%, respectively, at a final concentration of 1 mg/mL). The extract was fractionated and the fraction with the highest content of total phenolic compounds showed the highest bioactivity, suggesting that polyphenols could be mainly responsible for the abovementioned activities. The tentative polyphenol identification by HPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS in this fraction revealed that flavones (&gt;65%) are the major group, with apigenin (38%) predominating, followed by diosmin (17.7%) and luteolin (11.9%). They could presumably be the main elements responsible for the enzymatic inhibition activity. Additionally, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, p-coumaric acid and a hydroxycinnamic acid derivative (2-O-(p-cumaroyl)-l-malic acid) were found in the extract. To our knowledge, this is the first time that some of these activities have been reported for halophyte extracts.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the most important greenhouse gas in the atmosphere, which is mainly derived from microbial respiration in soil. Soil bacteria are an important part of the soil ecosystem and play an important role in the process of plant growth, mineralization, and decomposition of organic matter. In this paper, we discuss a laboratory incubation experiment that we conducted to investigate the CO2 emissions and the underlying bacterial communities under the natural succession of halophyte vegetation in the Yellow River Delta by using high-throughput sequencing technology and PICRUSt functional prediction. The results showed that the bacterial abundance and diversity increased significantly along with the succession of halophyte vegetation. Metabolic function is the dominant function of soil bacteria in the study area. With the succession of halophyte vegetation, the rate of CO2 emissions gradually increased, and were significantly higher in soil covered with vegetation than that of the bare land without vegetation coverage. These results helped to better understand the relationships of soil bacterial communities under the background of halophyte vegetation succession, which can help to make efficient strategies to mitigate CO2 emissions and enhance carbon sequestration.</jats:p>",

To identify the physiological mechanisms involved in this plant’s resistance to alkali stress, the relative growth rates, the quantities and compositions of organic acids accumulated and secreted through the roots into the rhyzosphere, the concentrations of inorganic ions, proline and other solutes accumulating in the shoots were measured. The results show that the organic acid constituents in the shoots and roots were much the same. These were predominantly malic acid, oxalic acid, citric acid and succinic acid. The total concentration of organic acids in the shoots increased strongly with increasing alkali stress. However, these either did not increase or they decreased slightly with increasing salt stress. Of the four organic acids, the concentration difference between salt‐ and alkali‐stressed plants was most striking for citric acid. This became the dominant organic acid component under alkali stress. Results show that proline is the main organic osmolyte, whereas the contribution of betaine to osmotic adjustment is insignificant under either salt or alkali stress. The main organic acid accumulated was not only an important organic osmotic regulator, but also an important negative charge contributor, playing important roles in ionic balance and pH adjustment. The concentrations of Na<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>, K<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>, Cl<jats:sup>−</jats:sup> and of organic acid were 80.7% of all solutes under salt stress.

The ionic balance was disrupted by the strong increase in Na<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> content under alkali stress. This perhaps explains why large amounts of the organic acids were accumulated. The organic acid concentration in the roots was lower than in the shoots. The roots secreted citric acid into the rhyzosphere only under alkali stress, secretion of the other organic acids was not detected.

Their resistance to salinization is due, among other things, to their high ability to detoxify free radicals, owing to the relatively high content of antioxidants. On the coast of the Baltic Sea and in the lagoons, there are several rare halophyte species included in the Red Book of the Kaliningrad Region (Russia) and the Baltic region, such as Spergularia marina (L.) Griseb. and Glaux maritima L. The aim of the research was to study the accumulation of certain groups of phenolic compounds in different parts of S. marina and G. maritima plants under conditions of weak and strong soil salinity, as well as to analyze the antioxidant, antibacterial, and fungicidal activity of extracts of the studied plant species. The present study showed an increase in total phenolic content in the roots and shoots of S. marina, and the shoots of G. maritima, in response to increased soil salinity. At the same time, the total content of flavonoids in all the studied parts of the two plant species remained unchanged. However, the content of individual flavonoids (hesperetin, epicatechin, apigenin derivative, luteolin derivative) in S. marina increased, for G. maritima there was a tendency to reduce the content of flavonoids in roots and shoots with an increase in soil salinity. There was an increase in the total content of hydroxycinnamic acids in the roots of Glaux maritima, as well as an increase in the content of protocatechuic acid in the roots and shoots of Spergularia marina. A positive relationship was established between the antioxidant activity of S. marina root extracts and the total content of phenolic compounds, as well as G. maritima shoots extracts and the total content of phenolic compounds. Extracts of S. marina showed no antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, and weak fungicidal activity of stem extracts and inflorescences grown on soils, with high levels of salinities, was detected against Candida albicans. The extracts of roots and shoots from G. maritima showed weak antimicrobial and fungicidal activity.</jats:p>",

Dark septate endophytes (DSEs) constitute an important component of the root mycobiome and they are often able to alleviate host abiotic stresses. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the beneficial association between the DSE Laburnicola rhizohalophila and its host, the native halophyte Suaeda salsa, using population genomics. Based on genome-wide Fst (pairwise fixation index) and Vst analyses, which compared the variance in allele frequencies of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and copy number variants (CNVs), respectively, we found a high level of genetic differentiation between two populations. CNV patterns revealed population-specific expansions and contractions. Interestingly, we identified a ~20 kbp genomic island of high divergence with a strong sign of positive selection. This region contains a melanin-biosynthetic polyketide synthase gene cluster linked to six additional genes likely involved in biosynthesis, membrane trafficking, regulation, and localization of melanin. Differences in growth yield and melanin biosynthesis between the two populations grown under 2% NaCl stress suggested that this genomic island contributes to the observed differences in melanin accumulation. Our findings provide a better understanding of the genetic and evolutionary mechanisms underlying the adaptation to saline conditions of the L. rhizohalophila–S. salsa symbiosis.</jats:p>",

Then, the acyl chain-containing saponins, pannosides were evaluated for their antiviral activities against enterovirus A71 (EV71), coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), and rhinovirus 1B (HRV1B). Pannosides exhibited antiviral activities against HRV1B, EV71, and CVB3.

Results indicated that myxobacterial communities in rhizosphere soils exhibited greater diversity and richness compared to nonrhizosphere soils. Soil physicochemical properties, particularly moisture content, were identified as key environmental factors influencing myxobacterial diversity. The halotolerant genus Haliangium was found to be predominant under saline-alkaline conditions. Additionally, myxobacteria demonstrated distinct ecological specificity and environmental adaptability between rhizosphere and nonrhizosphere soils. For example, the genus Enhygromyxa exhibited a negative correlation with soil moisture content in rhizosphere soils but a positive correlation with soil electrical conductivity in nonrhizosphere soils. Co-occurrence network analysis revealed complex interaction patterns among myxobacterial genera and other bacterial genera, with closer interactions observed in rhizosphere soils. This study highlights the importance of environmental factors in regulating microbial community structure and function in saline-alkaline wetlands, providing new insights into the ecological roles and interaction mechanisms of myxobacteria within the ecosystem. </jats:p>",

The N applications performed a “dose effect” that significantly enhanced the growth of Suaeda at low salt levels, while negative effects were displayed at high salt levels. Moderate N markedly benefited from Na+ and Cl− uptake, which was approximately 111 mg and 146 mg per plant at a salt level of 1.0%. Exposure to a certain N application significantly enhanced topsoil root length at salt levels of 0.5% and 1.0%, and it was higher by 0.766 m and 1.256 m under N50 treatment than that under N0 treatment, whereas the higher salt levels accelerate subsoil root growth regardless of N treatment. Therefore, its interactive effects on root development and ion uptake were present, which would provide further theoretical basis for improving saline soil amelioration by N application. Regression analysis always showed that topsoil root length generated more positive and significant influences on ion uptake and vegetative growth than total root length. The results suggested that N application is beneficial to salt tolerance by altering root allocation so as to raise its elongation and gather more ions for halophyte in the topsoil.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Seed germination is a key life‐history stage of halophytes. Most studies on seed germination of halophytes have focused on the effects of a single salt, while little information is available on the effects of mixed salt in the natural habitat. Due to the contribution of multiple ions in saline soil, we hypothesized that the effect of mixed salt on seed germination will differ from that of a single salt and the mechanism of how germination is affected will differ as well. The effects of mixed salt and NaCl on germination, water imbibition, and ionic concentrations of seeds of <jats:italic>Suaeda salsa</jats:italic> (L.) Pall. were compared at various salinity levels. Germination percentage (GP) and rate (GR) decreased with increasing salinity level, regardless of salt type. There was no difference in GP or GR between mixed salt and NaCl when the salinity level was below 20 dS m<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>. Above 20 dS m<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, GP and GR in NaCl were lower than those in mixed salt. At the same salinity level, Na<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> concentration in seeds was higher in NaCl than that in mixed salt, but the reverse was true for Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> and Mg<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> concentrations. Imbibition rate for seeds in NaCl was lower than that in mixed salt at the same salinity level. Addition of Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> and Mg<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> alleviated the inhibition of NaCl on seed germination. In conclusion, our results suggest that the effects of soil salts and NaCl on seed germination are different, and using NaCl instead of soil salt might not be realistic to show the effect of saline stress on seed germination of halophytes in the natural habitat.</jats:p>",

Water requirements were estimated in experimental plots on the coastal line and fulfilled with drip irrigation connected to seawater aquaculture discharge ponds, 30 m from the sea. The recorded phenological events were germination, flowering, fructification, maturation, and physiological death. Results reflect the difficulty to adopt it as a new crop because of its long-life cycle, around nine months, contrasting with the life cycle of common crops, from three to four months. Irrigation needs reached a depth of 240 cm, significantly exceeding those of conventional crops. Such limitations are highlighted, but also its potential use as a biofilter of coastal aquaculture effluents, being a productive target-biomass, feasible to be used as a dual-purpose use of water and energy required in aquaculture farms.</jats:p>",

This study assessed the plant’s response to these stressors and bacterial inoculation by analyzing various factors including the accumulation of elements such as sodium (Na), chloride (Cl), cadmium (Cd) and sulfur (S); growth parameters; levels of photosynthetic pigments, proline and phenolic compounds; the formation of malondialdehyde (MDA); and the plant’s potential to scavenge 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH). The results revealed that bacterial inoculation was effective in mitigating the deleterious effect of cadmium stress on some growth criteria. For instance, stem length was 2-hold higher, the growth tolerance index was 3-fold higher and there was a 20% increase in the content of photosynthetic pigments compared to non-inoculated plants. Furthermore, the SOB contributed to enhancing cadmium tolerance in Tripolium pannonicum by increasing the availability of sulfur in the plant’s leaves, which led to the maintenance of an appropriate, about 2-fold-higher level of phenolic compounds (phenylpropanoids and flavonols), as well as chloride ions. The level of MDA decreased after bacterial application in all experimental variants except when both salt and cadmium stress were present. These findings provide novel insights into how halophytes respond to abiotic stress following inoculation of the growth medium with sulfur-oxidizing bacteria. The data suggest that inoculating the substrate with SOB has a beneficial effect on T. pannonicum’s tolerance to cadmium stress.</jats:p>",

The antibacterial effects against major food-borne pathogenic and food spoilage bacteria were tested using the well diffusion method, followed by the determination of the minimum inhibitory (MIC) and bactericidal (MBC) concentrations. The essential oil has shown strong antimicrobial activity against eight pathogenic strains, which was attributed mostly to predominant constituents of the essential oil: benzyl alcohol, linalool, terpien-4-ol and globulol, as well as to synergistic effects of its major and minor constituents. Considering strong antimicrobial effects of the tested essential oil, it was further tested as a natural alternative to food preservatives, using minced beef meat as a model system. Minced beef meat was spiked with 0.019, 0.038, and 0.076% of the essential oil and stored during 14 days at 4 °C, monitoring its microbiological, physicochemical, and sensory properties. Chemical analyses revealed that meat treated with 0.076% of LmEO at underwent a significant decrease (p &lt; 0.05) in primary and secondary lipid oxidation and reduced metmyoglobin accumulation compared with control samples. Furthermore, microflora proliferation in the meat model system spiked with 0.076% of LmEO was significantly (p &lt; 0.05) reduced in comparison to control. In addition, two multivariate exploratory techniques, namely principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical analysis (HCA), were applied to the obtained data sets to describe the relationship between the main characteristics of the meat samples with and without essential oil addition. The chemometric approach highlighted the relationships between meat quality parameters. Overall, results indicated that the essential oil of Lobularia maritima deserves to be considered as a natural preservative in the meat industry.</jats:p>",

According to the Hydro-Environmental Availability Index (HEAI), the central regions of Mexico reflect a greater water availability, suitable for S. edulis. In such a humid region, HEAI varied from 6 to 18, indicating sufficient moisture for crops. In contrast, other Suaeda species, including S. nigra, S. esteroa, and S. californica, spread in NW Mexico and SW United States, where the water availability is null during the year, with HEAI scoring from 0 to 4.

Using the halophyte <jats:italic>Cakile maritima</jats:italic> as a model plant grown in hydroponic conditions, this study was aimed to analyze how the simultaneous stressful conditions of high salinity (400 mM NaCl) and K<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> deficiency (0 mM) for 15 days affect plant growth, ion balance, and antioxidant and NADPH-generating systems.

Its wild relative Solanum chilense was reported to have halophyte properties. We compared salt resistance of both species during the reproductive phase, with a special focus on sodium localization in the flowers. Plants were exposed to NaCl from the seedling stage. Salinity decreased the number of inflorescences in both species but the number of flowers per inflorescence and sepal length only in S. lycopersicum. External salt supply decreased the stamen length in S. chilense, and it was associated with a decrease in pollen production and an increase in pollen viability. Although the fruit set was not affected by salinity, fruit weight and size decreased in S. lycopersicum. Concentrations and localization of Na, K, Mg, and Ca differed in reproductive structures of both species. Inflorescences and fruits of S. chilense accumulated more Na than S. lycopersicum. Sodium was mainly located in male floral organs of S. chilense but in non-reproductive floral organs in S. lycopersicum. The expression of Na transporter genes differed in flowers of both species. Overall, our results indicated that S. chilense was more salt-resistant than S. lycopersicum during the reproductive phase and that differences could be partly related to dissimilarities in element distribution and transport in flowers.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>According to the EU, the global consumption of biomass, fossil fuels, metals, and minerals is expected to double by 2050, while waste will increase by 70%. In this context, the Circular Economy Action Plan (CEAP) intends to integrate development and sustainability. In this regard, tailored biofertilizers based on plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) can improve plant yield with fewer inputs. In our project, an autochthonous halophyte of the Andalusian marshes, namely Mesembryanthemum crystallinum, was selected for its interest as a source of pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals. The aim of this work was to use a culturomics approach for the isolation of specific PGPB and endophytes able to promote plant growth and, eventually, modulate the metabolome of the plant. For this purpose, a specific culture medium based on M. crystallinum biomass, called Mesem Agar (MA), was elaborated. Bacteria of three compartments (rhizosphere soil, root endophytes, and shoot endophytes) were isolated on standard tryptone soy agar (TSA) and MA in order to obtain two independent collections. A higher number of bacteria were isolated on TSA than in MA (47 vs. 37). All the bacteria were identified, and although some of them were isolated in both media (Pseudomonas, Bacillus, Priestia, Rosellomorea, etc.), either medium allowed the isolation of specific members of the M. crystallinum microbiome such as Leclercia, Curtobacterium, Pantoea, Lysinibacillus, Mesobacillus, Glutamicibacter, etc. Plant growth-promoting properties and extracellular degrading activities of all the strains were determined, and distinct patterns were found in both media. The three best bacteria of each collection were selected in order to produce two different consortia, whose effects on seed germination, root colonization, plant growth and physiology, and metabolomics were analyzed. Additionally, the results of the plant metabolome revealed a differential accumulation of several primary and secondary metabolites with pharmaceutical properties. Overall, the results demonstrated the feasibility of using “low cost media” based on plant biomass to carry out a culturomics approach in order to isolate the most suitable bacteria for biofertilizers. In this way, a circular model is established in which bacteria help plants to grow, and, in turn, a medium based on plant wastes supports bacterial growth at low prices, which is the reason why this approach can be considered within the model of “circular agronomy”.</jats:p>",

Male C57B6J/L mice were separately fed a normal diet (ND) or a high-fat diet (HFD) and daily administrated with NRE (50, 100 mg/kg) or one for 2 days with Naringenin (10 mg/kg). NRE administration significantly decreased body weight gain, fat pad weight, serum glucose, and lipid levels in HFD-induced obese mice. To elucidate the mechanism of action of NRE, the expression of genes involved in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism were measured in liver. Results showed that mice treated with NRE demonstrated a significant decrease in cumulative body weight and fat pad weight, a significant lowering in glucose and triglycerides serum levels, and an increase in the HDL-cholesterol serum level. Moreover mRNA expression results showed an enhancement of the expression of genes related to liver metabolism. Our findings suggest that NRE treatment had a protective or controlling effect against a high fat diet-induced obesity in C57B6J/L mice through the regulation of expression of genes involved in lipolysis and lipogenesis and thus the enhancement of the lipid metabolism in liver.</jats:p>",

Halophytes have evolved novel regulatory mechanisms to maintain a suitable K+/Na+ ratio during long-term adaptation. The wild halophyte Hordeum brevisubulatum can adopt efficient strategies to achieve synergistic levels of K+ and Na+ under high salt stress. However, little is known about its molecular mechanism. Our previous study indicated that HbCIPK2 contributed to prevention of Na+ accumulation and K+ reduction. Here, we further identified the HbCIPK2-interacting proteins including upstream Ca2+ sensors, HbCBL1, HbCBL4, and HbCBL10, and downstream phosphorylated targets, the voltage-gated K+ channel HbVGKC1 and SOS1-like transporter HbSOS1L. HbCBL1 combined with HbCIPK2 could activate HbVGKC1 to absorb K+, while the HbCBL4/10–HbCIPK2 complex modulated HbSOS1L to exclude Na+. This discovery suggested that crosstalk between the sodium response and the potassium uptake signaling pathways indeed exists for HbCIPK2 as the signal hub, and paved the way for understanding the novel mechanism of K+/Na+ homeostasis which has evolved in the halophytic grass.</jats:p>",

A large number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in the roots and leaves of plants grown under salt stress.

However, there remains a gap in our comprehension of non‐halophyte plants' water uptake patterns and driving factors in temperate coastal regions. For this reason, we used locust trees (a widely planted non‐halophyte tree species in northern China) as a study subject. We collected water isotope data (δ<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>H and δ<jats:sup>18</jats:sup>O) for locust trees xylem and soil over two consecutive growing seasons. The MixSIAR model was used along with five distinct sets of input data (single isotopes, uncorrected dual isotopes, and corrected dual isotopes incorporating δ<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>H data obtained by soil water line or cryogenic vacuum distillation methods) to infer water utilization patterns. The results indicated that locust trees primarily absorb shallow soil water (0–20 cm, 29.4% ± 16.9%) and deep soil water (120–180 cm, 24.7% ± 5.8%). Pearson's correlation analysis revealed the key driving factors behind water uptake patterns were vegetation transpiration and soil salinity. Remarkably, the build up of salts in the lower soil layer (60–120 cm) hinders the absorption of water by plants. To prevent high salt concentrations from affecting water uptake in non‐halophyte plants, we recommend implementing sufficient irrigation from March to April each year to meet the water needs of plant growth and regulate the accumulation of salts in various soil layers.

Myo-inositol is the precursor for the synthesis of compatible solute D-pinitol and promotes Na+ transport in ice plants. We previously showed that supplying myo-inositol to 9-day-old seedlings alleviates salt damage by coordinating the expression of genes involved in inositol synthesis and transport, affecting osmotic adjustment and the Na/K balance. In this study, we examined the effects of myo-inositol on physiological parameters and inositol-related gene expression in early- and late-stage juvenile plants. The addition of myo-inositol to salt-treated, hydroponically grown late juvenile plants had no significant effects on growth or photosynthesis. In contrast, supplying exogenous myo-inositol to salt-treated early juvenile plants increased leaf biomass, relative water content, and chlorophyll content and improved PSII activity and CO2 assimilation. The treatment combining high salt and myo-inositol synergistically induced the expression of myo-inositol phosphate synthase (INPS), myo-inositol O-methyltransferase (IMT), and inositol transporters (INTs), which modulated root-to-shoot Na/K ratio and increased leaf D-pinitol content.

The integrative proteomic and transcriptomic analysis detected 64 DAP whose regulations were concordant with those of the corresponding differentially expressed genes.

NADES and conventional extracts were made by an ultrasound-assisted procedure and evaluated for in vitro antioxidant properties by the radical scavenging activity (RSA) on the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical, oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), and copper chelating activity (CCA). Samples were profiled by liquid chromatography (LC)-electrospray ionization (ESI)-QTOF-MS analysis. ChCl:fructose was more efficient in the DPPH assay, than the acetone extract. ChCl:sucrose and ChCl:fructose extracts had the highest ORAC when compared with the acetone extract. NADES extracts had higher CCA, than the acetone extract. The phenolic composition of the NADES extracts was less complex than the conventional extracts, but the proportions of major antioxidants, such as flavonols and flavan-3-ols, were similar in all the solvents. Myricitrin was the major flavonoid in all of the samples, while gallic acid was the main phenolic acid in the conventional extracts and present in a greater amount in ChCl:fructose. Results suggest that NADES containing ChCl and sucrose/fructose can replace conventional solvents, especially acetone, in the extraction of antioxidants from sea knotgrass.</jats:p>",

Coastal saline environments are major contributors to regional and global biodiversity and an important source of endemic species. However, various species are in decline or considered threatened, particularly halophytes (salt tolerant) due to negative anthropic impacts. The Lusitanian endemic halophyte <jats:italic>Limonium daveaui</jats:italic> formerly had a large distribution range along the west coast of Portugal but currently it shows a restricted distribution in the Tagus estuary. Field surveys revealed that this critically endangered species forms few local populations with small size invaded by exotic species. In this study, we investigated the potential utilization of Technosols, an innovative sustainable, ecological engineering method combined with brackish water irrigation for potential <jats:italic>L. daveaui</jats:italic> reintroduction in native habitats. Seed germination percentages were evaluated in different environmental conditions. Through a microcosm assay, a Technosol was constructed using a saline Fluvisol with a mixture of low value inorganic and organic wastes, which were chemically characterized. Plants were cultivated in the Fluvisol and Technosol and irrigated with brackish water collected in the nearby area. To assess plant growth, morphometric parameters and the plants’ physiological status were assessed and the fresh and dry biomass determined. Results showed that seed germination was higher on moist filter paper with distilled water than in Fluvisol or Technosol. Plants grown in Technosol had a greater development, with higher values of photosynthetic indexes and biomass production than in Fluvisol.

In <jats:italic>P. tenuiflora</jats:italic> plants, 493 root exudates were detected under control conditions, 544 root exudates under salt stress conditions, and 607 root exudates under alkali stress conditions. Salt‐stressed plants and alkali‐stressed plants shared 64 root exudates, and 60 root exudates were unique to alkali‐stressed plants. The secretion rate of 56 phenolic acids, 43 fatty acids, and 9 organic acids was faster in alkali‐stressed roots than in control and salt‐stressed roots. In <jats:italic>P. tenuiflora</jats:italic> roots, alkali stress enhanced the accumulation of 23 phenolic acids, five organic acids, and only one fatty acid. In addition, transcriptomic analysis revealed that alkali stress upregulated glycolysis and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathways in <jats:italic>P. tenuiflora</jats:italic> roots.

The root secretion of <jats:italic>P. tenuiflora</jats:italic> upon alkali stress is highly organized.

The results showed that brown seeds had significantly higher H2O2 and O2−. levels and betaine content, as well as POD and CAT activities, while they had significantly lower MDA and proline contents and SOD activity than black seeds.

In this work, using highly salt-tolerant clones of Arthrocaulon macrostachyum obtained previously from in vitro micropropagation and selection, we compared the physiological and biochemical responses of these clones and their wild counterparts to high salinity levels (428 mM NaCl) under glasshouse conditions. In vitro-derived clones displayed a superior biomass production (27%) and higher chloride concentration in the shoot (28%), compared to the wild plants. On the other hand, wild specimens showed more stress symptoms and a less efficient photosynthesis, which was correlated with higher levels of oxidative stress and with a remarkable induction of peroxidase activity. Therefore, a higher incidence of salinity-related oxidative stress in the wild halophytes in comparison to the clones is concluded. This represents the first ex vitro evaluation of halophyte clones selected by means of micropropagation and provides insights into the salinity tolerance mechanisms of A. macrostachyum.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Understanding heavy metal behavior in arid saline soils is critical for phytoremediation in degraded lands. This study investigated metal distribution and plant enrichment in the Tarim Basin using 323 soil and 55 plant samples (Populus euphratica, Tamarix ramosissima, cotton, jujube). Analyses included redundancy analysis (RDA) and bioconcentration factor (BCF) assessments. Key findings reveal that elevated salinity (total salts, TS &gt; 200 g/kg) and alkalinity (pH &gt; 8.5) immobilized As, Cd, Cu, and Zn. Precipitation and competitive leaching reduced metal mobility by 42–68%. Plant enrichment strategies diverged significantly: P. euphratica hyperaccumulated Cd (BCF = 1.59) and Zn (BCF = 2.41), while T. ramosissima accumulated As and Pb (BCF &gt; 0.05). Conversely, cotton posed Hg transfer risks (BCF = 2.15), and jujube approached Cd safety thresholds in phosphorus-rich soils. RDA indicated that pH and total salinity (TS) jointly suppressed metal bioavailability, explaining 57.6% of variance. Total phosphorus (TP) and soil organic carbon (SOC) enhanced metal availability (36.8% variance), with notable TP-Cd synergy (Pearson’s r = 0.42). We propose a dual-threshold management framework: (1) leveraging salinity–alkalinity suppression (TS &gt; 200 g/kg + pH &gt; 8.5) for natural immobilization; and (2) implementing TP control (TP &gt; 0.8 g/kg) to mitigate crop Cd risks. P. euphratica demonstrates targeted phytoremediation potential for degraded saline agricultural systems. This framework guides practical management by spatially delineating zones for natural immobilization versus targeted remediation (e.g., P. euphratica planting in Cd/Zn hotspots) and implementing phosphorus control in high-risk croplands.</jats:p>",

The nutritional profile and the concentration of macro and micro elements, including potential toxic elements, was also established. Fresh shoots and green salt were incorporated in catering meals (soup and a meat dish) and subjected to sensory analyses. The microbiological quality of fresh shoots and green salt was compliant with the guidelines for salad greens and herbs and spices, respectively. The nutritional and elemental profile revealed that fresh shoots have a high content in fibre and NaCl. From the concentration of Na determined in green salt, a daily dose of 7 g was estimated as corresponding to the recommended daily dietary intake Na. None of the other elements was present in concentrations that could exceed the dietary intake limits. In the sensory tests, fresh shoots were well accepted as salad greens but green salt, used as seasoning, was considered as insufficient in terms of saltiness and does not completely substitute cooking salt. The results confirm the nutritional and sensory value of<jats:italic>S. ramossisima</jats:italic>and represent a promising prospect for the incorporation of locally harvested or crop cultivated plants in catering meals.</jats:p>",

Analyses of a 10-Mb scaffold revealed synteny with Arabidopsis, with recombination and inversion and an uneven distribution of repeat sequences. T. parvula genome structure and DNA sequences were compared with orthologous regions from Arabidopsis and publicly available bacterial artificial chromosome sequences from Thellungiella salsuginea (previously Thellungiella halophila). The three-way comparison of sequences, from one abiotic stress-sensitive species and two tolerant species, revealed extensive sequence conservation and microcolinearity, but grouping Thellungiella species separately from Arabidopsis. However, the T. parvula segments are distinguished from their T. salsuginea counterparts by a pronounced paucity of repeat sequences, resulting in a 30% shorter DNA segment with essentially the same gene content in T. parvula. Among the genes is SALT OVERLY SENSITIVE1 (SOS1), a sodium/proton antiporter, which represents an essential component of plant salinity stress tolerance. Although the SOS1 coding region is highly conserved among all three species, the promoter regions show conservation only between the two Thellungiella species. Comparative transcript analyses revealed higher levels of basal as well as salt-induced SOS1 expression in both Thellungiella species as compared with Arabidopsis. The Thellungiella species and other halophytes share conserved pyrimidine-rich 5′ untranslated region proximal regions of SOS1 that are missing in Arabidopsis. Completion of the genome structure of T. parvula is expected to highlight distinctive genetic elements underlying the extremophile lifestyle of this species.</jats:p>",

Composts were used both pure and mixed with peat at a dose of 50% on a volume basis. We hypothesized that the halophytic nature of this plant might overcome the limitations of high-salinity compost-based growing media. The growth parameters, color traits and trace metals content (Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn) of the edible parts were compared. Independently of the substrates, the average total and edible yields were 51 and 30 g plant−1, respectively, while the average waste portion was about 41%. The use of posidonia-based compost did not affect the color traits of sea fennel plants as compared with samples grown on the commercial peat-based substrate. In general, potted sea fennel grown on both posidonia-based composts and commercial peat-based substrate appeared a good source of essential micronutrients. Only a weak reduction of Fe and Mn concentrations was observed in plants grown on posidonia-based composts, especially when used at the highest dose. Independently of the growing medium, the content of potentially hazardous trace elements (Cd and Pb) in the edible parts of sea fennel was always below the maximum admissible limits fixed by the European legislation.

Excessive salt level, known to limit plant growth, is not harmful to halophytes, which have developed a variety of defense mechanisms allowing them to colonize harsh environments. Plants under stress are known to respond with several morpho-anatomical adaptations, but also to enhance the production of secondary metabolites to better cope with difficult conditions. Owing to these adaptations, halophytes are an interesting group of undemanding plants with a high potential for application in the food and pharmaceutical industries. Therefore, this review aims to present the characteristics of halophytes, describe changes in their gene expression, and discuss their synthesized metabolites of pharmacognostic and pharmacological significance. Lobularia maritima is characterized as a widely spread halophyte that has been shown to exhibit various pharmacological properties in vitro and in vivo. It is concluded that halophytes may become important sources of natural products for the treatment of various ailments and for supplementing the human diet with necessary non-nutrients and minerals.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The Earth is undergoing alterations at a high speed, which causes problems such as environmental pollution and difficulty in food production. This is where halophytes are interesting, due to their high potential in different fields, such as remediation of the environment and agriculture. For this reason, it is necessary to deepen the knowledge of the development of halophytes and how plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGP) can play a fundamental role in this process. Therefore, in this work were tested the effects of five PGP bacteria on its rhizosphere and other endophytic bacteria at different concentrations of NaCl on seed germination, plant growth (0 and 171 mM) and cutting growth (0 mM) of Arthrocaulon macrostachyum. The growth promotion in this strict halophyte is highlighted due to the presence of PGP bacteria and the fact that no salt is needed. Thus, without salt, the bacterial strains Kocuria polaris Hv16, Pseudarthrobacter psychrotolerans C58, and Rahnella aceris RTE9 enhanced the biomass production by more than 60% in both stems and roots. Furthermore, germination was encouraged by more than 30% in the presence of both R. aceris RTE9 and K. polaris Hv16 at 171 mM NaCl; the latter also had a biocontrol effect on the fungi that grew on the seeds. Additionally, for the first time in cuttings of this perennial species, the root biomass was improved thanks to the consortium of K. polaris Hv16 and P. psychrotolerans C58. Finally, this study demonstrates the potential of PGPs for optimising the development of halophytes, either for environmental or agronomic purposes.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Halophytes represent important models for studying the key mechanisms of salt tolerance. One approach to the development of new knowledge of salt tolerance is to study the properties of detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs). In this work, the lipid profiles of DRMs of chloroplasts and mitochondria of euhalophyte Salicornia perennans Willd, before and after their exposure to shock concentrations of NaCl, have been investigated. We found that DRMs of chloroplasts are enriched in cerebrosides (CERs) and that sterols (STs) dominate the mass of mitochondrial DRMs. Also, it has been proven that (i) the impact of salinity provokes obvious growth in the content of CERs in DRMs of chloroplasts; (ii) the content of STs in DRMs of chloroplasts does not change under the influence of NaCl; (iii) salinity also causes some elevation in the content of monounsaturated and saturated fatty acids (FAs). Considering the fact that DRMs represent integral parts of both chloroplast and mitochondrial membranes, the authors have come to the conclusion that the cells of euhalophyte S. perennans, under the impact of salinity, presumes the choice (by the cell) of some specific composition of lipids and FAs in the membrane. This may be considered as a specific protection reaction of the plant cell against salinity.</jats:p>",

Tetradecanoic acid/esters and 1,2-tetradecanediol were identified in its flower extract, while the leaf extract was rich in linolenic and linoleic acids and their esters, hexadecanoic acid and its esters, and phytol. Both flower and leaf hydromethanolic extracts contained eicosane, sitosterol and tocopherols in significant amounts. With a view to its valorization, the antimicrobial activity of these extracts was investigated against three apple tree and grapevine phytopathogens. Both the hydroalcoholic extracts and their main constituents, alone or in combination with chitosan oligomers (COS), were tested in vitro. A remarkable antibacterial activity was observed for the conjugated complexes of the flower extract with COS, both against Xylophilus ampelinus (MIC = 250 μg·mL−1) and Erwinia amylovora (MIC = 500 μg·mL−1), and complete inhibition of the mycelial growth of Diplodia seriata was found at concentrations &lt;1000 μg·mL−1. In view of these results, this extremophile plant can be put forward as a promising source of bioactive metabolites.</jats:p>",

However, the differential responses of mangrove plant at the combined transcriptome and metabolome level to variable salinity are not well documented. In this study, we used Avicennia marina (Forssk.) Vierh., a pioneer species of mangrove wetlands and one of the most salt-tolerant mangroves, to investigate the differential salt tolerance mechanisms under low and high salinity using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry, transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis. The results showed that HAK8 was up-regulated and transported K+ into the roots under low salinity. However, under high salinity, AKT1 and NHX2 were strongly induced, which indicated the transport of K+ and Na+ compartmentalization to maintain ion homeostasis. In addition, A. marina tolerates low salinity by up-regulating ABA signaling pathway and accumulating more mannitol, unsaturated fatty acids, amino acids' and L-ascorbic acid in the roots. Under high salinity, A. marina undergoes a more drastic metabolic network rearrangement in the roots, such as more L-ascorbic acid and oxiglutatione were up-regulated, while carbohydrates, lipids and amino acids were down-regulated in the roots, and, finally, glycolysis and TCA cycle were promoted to provide more energy to improve salt tolerance. Our findings suggest that the major salt tolerance traits in A. marina can be attributed to complex regulatory and signaling mechanisms, and show significant differences between low and high salinity.</jats:p>",

Further, to describe the chemical content of the matrix, GC-MS analyses after silylation were performed; the obtained results showed the presence of a large number of components belonging to several chemical classes, mostly sugar alcohols, sugars, fatty acids, and terpenes. Firstly, the antibacterial activities of this fraction and linalool (Lin) were evaluated against eight foodborne pathogenic strains with MIC values between 2.3 and 5.8 mg/mL and 0.23 and 0.7 mg/mL, respectively. Then, the antioxidant activity of both was evaluated by the DPPH antiradical test and the phosphomolybdenum test. Furthermore, the biopreservative effect of LmFV alone and in combination with Lin on minced beef stored at 4 °C for 14 days was evaluated using microbiological and physiochemical tests. LmFV at 4.6% alone significantly reduced microbial spoilage in ground meat (p &lt; 0.05). The combination of LmFV (4.6%) and Lin (0.46%) was more effective than LmFV alone in inhibiting bacterial contamination, reducing TBARS values and the risk of bacterial contamination, and reducing the accumulation of Met myoglobin (MetMb). This combination, therefore, extends the shelf life of the product by about 10 days. Based on these microbiological results and physicochemical parameters, it can be stated that the addition of Lin potentiates the flavonoid fraction of L. maritima more strongly against the deterioration of meat quality by significantly improving its biopreservative effect as a natural conservative.</jats:p>",

Yet, the effect of abiotic conditions, such as salinity and temperature, on the FA profile of S. ramosissima remains largely unknown. These factors can potentially shape its nutritional composition and yield unique fatty acid signatures that can reveal its geographical origin. In this context, samples of S. ramosissima were collected from four different locations along the coastline of mainland Portugal and their FAs were profiled through gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. The lipid extracts displayed a high content of essential FAs, such as 18:2n-6 and 18:3n-3. In addition to an epoxide fatty acid exclusively identified in samples from the Mondego estuary, the relative abundance of FAs varied between origin sites, revealing that FA profiles can be used as site-specific lipid fingerprints. This study highlights the role of abiotic conditions on the nutritional profile of S. ramosissima and establishes FA profiling as a potential avenue to trace the geographic origin of this halophyte plant. Overall, the present approach can make origin certification possible, safeguard quality, and enhance consumers’ trust in novel foods.</jats:p>",

These studies have been conducted in settings where cells are subjected to stress, either hypo- or hyperosmotic, which can be a confounding factor in describing physiological mechanisms related to salinity. (2) Methods: We have studied transcriptomic changes in Aspergillus sydowii, a halophilic species, when growing in three different salinity conditions (No NaCl, 0.5 M, and 2.0 M NaCl). (3) Results: In this fungus, major physiological modifications occur under high salinity (2.0 M NaCl) and not when cultured under optimal conditions (0.5 M NaCl), suggesting that most of the mechanisms described for halophilic growth are a consequence of saline stress response and not an adaptation to saline conditions. Cell wall modifications occur exclusively at extreme salinity, with an increase in cell wall thickness and lamellar structure, which seem to involve a decrease in chitin content and an augmented content of alfa and beta-glucans. Additionally, three hydrophobin genes were differentially expressed under hypo- or hyperosmotic stress but not when the fungus grows optimally. Regarding compatible solutes, glycerol is the main compound accumulated in salt stress conditions, whereas trehalose is accumulated in the absence of salt. (4) Conclusions: Physiological responses to salinity vary greatly between optimal and high salt concentrations and are not a simple graded effect as the salt concentration increases. Our results highlight the influence of stress in reshaping the response of extremophiles to environmental challenges.</jats:p>",

The incorporation of S. perennis increased the specific volume but had no relevant impact on the textural properties of bread. Furthermore, the substitution of sodium chloride by S. perennis powder allowed a more colored (greenish and yellowish) and dark crumb leading to a lower whiteness index. Compared with control bread, the addition of S. perennis powder promoted a significant increase of all bread’s nutrients and minerals, namely calcium, phosphor, iron, and manganese. Besides the improvement of bread quality, B100, and B50 bread samples were both sensorily well accepted and with similar scores to all the evaluated sensorial attributes. Moreover, the reduction of sodium to half (0.235% sodium (flour basis) in bread (B50) did not affect the acceptability of tasters, as compared with B100 (0.47% sodium (flour basis)). Both new bread formulation has microbiological quality as ready-to-eat product. However, taking into account greater stability over time for microbial spoilage, mainly caused by fungi and yeasts, B50 bread is more promising. The B50 bread sample is also a potential strategy to obtain a sodium reduction of 50% in bread, which could be essential to reduce the overall sodium daily intake and bring important economic and public health benefits.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Global warming and climate change have contributed to the rise of weather extremes. Severe drought and soil salinization increase because of rising temperatures. Economically important crop production and plant growth and development are hindered when facing various abiotic stresses. Plant endophytic bacteria live inside host plants without causing visible harm and can be isolated from surface-sterilized plant tissues. Using plant endophytic bacteria to stimulate plant growth and increase environmental stress tolerance has become an alternative approach besides using the traditional breeding and genetically modifying approaches to select or create new crop types resistant to different environmental stresses. The plant endophytic bacterium, Priestia megaterium (previously known as Bacillus megaterium) strain BP-R2, was isolated from the surface-sterilized root tissues of the salt marsh halophyte Bolboschoenus planiculmis. The bacteria strain BP-R2 showed high tolerance to different sodium chloride (NaCl) concentrations and produced the auxin plant hormone, indole acetic acid (IAA), under various tested growth conditions. Inoculation of Arabidopsis and pak choi (Brassica rapa L. R. Chinensis Group) plants with the strain BP-R2 greatly enhanced different growth parameters of the host plants under normal and salt and drought stress conditions compared to that of the mock-inoculated plants. Furthermore, the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) content, electrolyte leakage (EL), and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration accumulated less in the BP-R2-inoculated plants than in the mock-inoculated control plants under salt and drought stresses. In summary, the plant endophytic bacterium strain BP-R2 increased host plant growth and stress tolerance to salt and drought conditions.</jats:p>",

Which of the many well‐known salt‐tolerance strategies are combined to fine‐tune this remarkable resilience is unknown. The precise location, whether in the shoot or the root, where these strategies are employed remains uncertain, leaving us unaware of how the various known salt‐tolerance mechanisms are integrated to fine‐tune this remarkable resilience. To address this shortcoming, we exposed date palm to a salt stress dose equivalent to seawater for up to 4 weeks and applied integrative multi‐omics analyses followed by targeted metabolomics, hormone, and ion analyses. Integration of proteomic into transcriptomic data allowed a view beyond simple correlation, revealing a remarkably high degree of convergence between gene expression and protein abundance. This sheds a clear light on the acclimatization mechanisms employed, which depend on reprogramming of protein biosynthesis. For growth in highly saline habitats, date palm effectively combines various salt‐tolerance mechanisms found in both halophytes and glycophytes: “avoidance” by efficient sodium and chloride exclusion at the roots, and “acclimation” by osmotic adjustment, reactive oxygen species scavenging in leaves, and remodeling of the ribosome‐associated proteome in salt‐exposed root cells.

Within the soil profile, salinity is a dynamic indicator and significantly changes with depth. The present study examined the effects of the vertical heterogeneity of soil salinity chemistry on the plant height, fresh and dry biomass accumulation, water content, level of genetic polymorphism, and observed and expected heterozygosity in seven populations of halophyte Bassia prostrata in natural habitats. Soil salinity ranged from slight (Ssalts = 0.11–0.25%) to extreme (Ssalts = 1.35–2.57%). The main contributors to salinity were Na+, Ca2+, and Mg2+. Multivariate analysis revealed that biomass accumulation is positively affected by moderate/high salinity in 20–60 cm soil layers, which may be associated with the salt required for the optimal growth of the halophyte B. prostrata. The formation of seed genetic diversity is negatively affected by slight/moderate salinity in the 0–40 cm layers. An increase in divalent ion content can reduce genetic diversity and increase the local adaptation of B. prostrata to magnesium–calcium sulfate salinity. The effect of the in-depth distribution of soil salinity on productivity and genetic diversity may be related to seasonal variables during biomass accumulation (summer) and seed formation (autumn).</jats:p>",

These enzymes include cellulases (GH3, GH5, GH9 and GH30), xylanases (GH5, GH10, GH43, GH51, GH67, and GH115), mannanases (GH2, GH26, GH27 and GH113) and xyloglucanases (GH2, GH5, GH16, GH29, GH31 and GH95).

A microcosm assay was conducted under controlled greenhouse conditions to cultivate L. algarvense using a saline Fluvisol (FLU) amended—or not—with a Technosol (TEC). Plants were inoculated with the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (AMF) Rhizoglomus irregulare and/or a consortium of plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB), and they were irrigated with estuarine water. Soil enzyme analysis and physicochemical characterisation of the soils, collected at the beginning and at the end of the assay, were carried out. The physiological status of non-inoculated and inoculated plants was monitored during the assay for 4 months, and AMF root colonisation was evaluated. In FLU, only plants inoculated with the AMF survived. These plants had lower number of leaves, and shoot and root dry biomass than the ones grown in the TEC by the end of the assay. In the TEC, PGPB inoculation led to higher NDVI and PRI values, and AMF inoculation promoted higher reproductive development but not pollen fertility. The findings show that the combined use of soil and microbial technologies can be successfully applied to cultivate L. algarvense, suggesting their generalized use for other Limonium species with economic interest, while contributing to the sustainable use of marginal lands.</jats:p>",

We compare transcriptomes from A. marina pneumatophores, stems, leaves, flowers, seeds, and transcriptomes across four widely divergent environments in the Indo-Pacific (Red Sea, Arabian Gulf, Bay of Bengal, and Red River Delta) to decipher the shared and location-, tissue-, and condition-specific functions. On average, 4.8% of transcripts per tissue were uniquely expressed in that tissue, and 12.2% were shared in all five tissues. Flowers’ transcript expression was the most distinct, with domain-centric gene ontology analysis showing high enrichment for stimulus-responsive processes, as well as genes implicated in flowering (hydroxygeraniol dehydrogenase, TPM = 3687) and floral scent biosynthesis (e.g., benzoyl_coenzyme_A, 2497.2 TPM). Pneumatophores highly expressed antioxidant genes, such as glutathione S-transferase (GST, TPM = 4759) and thioredoxin (TRX, TPM = 936.2), as well as proteins in the GO term ‘Hydroquinone:oxygen oxidoreductase activity’ (enrichment Z = 7.69, FDR-corr. p = 0.000785). Tissue-specific metabolic pathway reconstruction revealed unique processes in the five tissues; for example, seeds showed the most complete expression of lipid biosynthetic and degradation pathways.

Metallothioneins (MTs) were the highest-expressed genes in all tissues from the cultivars of all locations; the dominant expression of these metal-binding and oxidative-stress control genes indicates they are essential for A. marina in its natural habitats.

In this study, Staphylococcus epidermidis Y2 was isolated and identified by 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) homology comparison and ammonia, pH, carbonic anhydrase, carbonate, and bicarbonate ions were monitored during laboratory experiments. The mineral phase, morphology, and elemental composition of precipitates were analyzed by XRD and SEM-EDS. Ultrathin slices of bacteria were analyzed by HRTEM-SAED and STEM. The results show that this bacterium releases ammonia and carbonic anhydrase to increase pH, and raise supersaturation via the large number of carbonate and bicarbonate ions that are released through carbon dioxide hydration catalyzed by carbonic anhydrase. The crystal cell density of monohydrocalcite is lower in a magnesium chloride medium, compared to one of magnesium sulfate. Crystals grow in the mode of a spiral staircase in a magnesium sulfate medium, but in a concentric circular pattern in a magnesium chloride medium.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Although biomineralization of minerals induced by microorganisms has been widely reported, the mechanisms of biomineralization and the characteristics of the biominerals precipitated needs to be studied further. In this study, Staphylococcus warneri YXY2, a moderate halophile, was used to induce the precipitation of carbonate minerals at various Mg/Ca molar ratios. To investigate the biomineralization mechanism, the growth curve, pH changes, ammonia test, the concentration of bicarbonate and carbonate ions, and the activity of carbonic anhydrase (CA) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were determined. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy - energy disperse spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), and stable carbon isotope analyses were used to characterize the minerals. The obtained biotic minerals were calcite, vaterite, Mg-rich calcite, and aragonite crystals. The crystallinity of aragonite decreased with increasing Mg/Ca ratios. The preferred orientation, diverse morphologies, organic substances, and more negative stable carbon isotope values proved the biogenesis of these carbonate minerals. The presence of Mg in the biotic aragonite crystals was likely related to the acidic amino acids which also facilitated the nucleation of minerals on/in the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). Mg2+ and Ca2+ ions were able to enter into the YXY2 bacteria to induce intracellular biomineralization. Dynamics simulation using Material Studio software proved that different adsorption energies of Glutamic acid (Glu) adsorbed onto different crystal planes of aragonite led to the preferred orientation of aragonite. This study helps to deepen our understanding of biomineralization mechanisms and may be helpful to distinguish biotic minerals from abiotic minerals.</jats:p>",

However, the molecular basis of its high salt tolerance remains elusive. In this study, we used Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) full-length single-molecule long-read sequencing and RNA-seq to elucidate the transcriptome dynamics of high salt tolerance in Spartina by salt gradient experiments. High-quality unigenes, transcription factors, non-coding RNA and Spartina-specific transcripts were identified. Co-expression network analysis found that protein kinase-encoding genes (SaOST1, SaCIPK10 and SaLRRs) are hub genes in the salt tolerance regulatory network. High salt stress induced the expression of transcription factors but repressed the expression of long non-coding RNAs. The Spartina transcriptome is closer to rice than Arabidopsis, and a higher proportion of transporter and transcription factor-encoding transcripts have been found in Spartina. Transcriptome analysis showed that high salt stress induced the expression of carbohydrate metabolism, especially cell-wall biosynthesis-related genes in Spartina, and repressed its expression in rice. Compared with rice, high salt stress highly induced the expression of stress response, protein modification and redox-related gene expression and greatly inhibited translation in Spartina. High salt stress also induced alternative splicing in Spartina, while differentially expressed alternative splicing events associated with photosynthesis were overrepresented in Spartina but not in rice. Finally, we built the SAPacBio website for visualizing full-length transcriptome sequences, transcription factors, ncRNAs, salt-tolerant genes and alternative splicing events in Spartina. Overall, this study suggests that the salt tolerance mechanism in Spartina is different from rice in many aspects and is far more complex than expected.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The halophilic bacterium Halomonas smyrnensis from a modern salt lake used in experiments to induce biomineralization has resulted in the precipitation of monohydrocalcite and other carbonate minerals. In this study, a Halomonas smyrnensis WMS-3 (GenBank:MH425323) strain was identified based on 16S rDNA homology comparison, and then cultured in mediums with 3% NaCl concentration to induce monohydrocalcite at different Mg/Ca molar ratios of 0, 2, 5, 7, and 9. The growth curve of WMS-3 bacteria, pH values, NH4+ concentration, HCO3− and CO32− concentration, carbonic anhydrase (CA) activity, and the changes in Ca2+ and Mg2+ ion concentration were determined to further explore the extracellular biomineralization mechanism. Moreover, the nucleation mechanism of monohydrocalcite on extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) was analyzed through studying ultrathin slices of the WMS-3 strain by High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), Selected area election diffraction (SAED), Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), and elemental mapping, besides this, amino acids in the EPS were also analyzed. The results show that pH increased to about 9.0 under the influence of ammonia and CA activity. The precipitation ratio (%, the ratio of the mass/volume concentration) of the Ca2+ ion was 64.32%, 62.20%, 60.22%, 59.57%, and 54.42% at Mg/Ca molar ratios of 0, 2, 5, 7, and 9, respectively, on the 21st day of the experiments, and 6.69%, 7.10%, 7.74%, 8.09% for the Mg2+ ion concentration at Mg/Ca molar ratios 2, 5, 7, and 9, respectively. The obtained minerals were calcite, Mg-rich calcite, aragonite, and hydromagnesite, in addition to the monohydrocalcite, as identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses. Monohydrocalcite had higher crystallinity when the Mg/Ca ratio increased from 7 to 9; thus, the stability of monohydrocalcite increased, also proven by the thermogravimetry (TG), derivative thermogravimetry (DTG) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analyses. The C=O and C–O–C organic functional groups present in/on the minerals analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), the various morphologies and the existence of P and S determined by scanning electron microscope-energy dispersive spectrometer (SEM-EDS), the relatively more negative stable carbon isotope values (−16.91‰ to −17.91‰) analyzed by a carbon isotope laser spectrometer, plus the typical surface chemistry by XPS, all support the biogenesis of these mineral precipitates. Moreover, Ca2+ ions were able to enter the bacterial cell to induce intracellular biomineralization. This study is useful to understand the mechanism of biomineralization further and may provide theoretical reference concerning the formation of monohydrocalcite in nature.</jats:p>",

Various extraction procedures were also performed to understand which methods were most suitable for extracting the various antioxidant compounds. Therefore, the aim of this study was to characterize the antioxidant compounds in halophytes and seaweed using various methods (ABTS, DPPH and FRAP), as well as the phenolic (TPC) and flavonoid (TFC) contents in the different extracts obtained. The amount of soluble protein in each extract was also determined. The results show that methanolic extracts generally have a higher antioxidant capacity, while the highest soluble protein content was observed in aqueous extracts. The seaweed Fucus Spiralis showed the highest antioxidant content, while in halophytic plants the highest antioxidant content was detected in the leaves. In general, this work confirms the potential of halophytes and seaweed as sources of antioxidant compounds for use in the food and pharmaceutical industries.</jats:p>",

Microbial communities of halophytes are being studied extensively as potential sources of bioactive compounds. Therefore, it is of interest to identify the secondary metabolites of the rhizospheric bacterial Desertihabitans sp. FB5 from the halophyte Salsola Imbricata. Strain Desertihabitans sp. FB5 was identified using a molecular technique (16S rDNA) and showed a similarity of 99% to Desertihabitans aurantiacus CPCC 204711T. Antifungal activity of the strain was tested against five different pathogenic fungi: Fusarium moniliforme, Altenaria mali, Magnaporthe grisea, Phytophthora capsici and Pythium ultimum in an in vitro assay. Desertihabitans sp. FB5 showed weak-to-moderate inhibition of different pathogenic fungi tested in the inhibitory assay. The production of lytic enzymes was evaluated using different enzymatic activities. Desertihabitans sp. FB5 was positive for both cellulolytic and lipolytic activities. To detect bioactive metabolites, gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) were performed. Both analyses showed the presence of the antimicrobial compound bacitracin and phytohormones, Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and Gibberellin A3 (GA3) in the culture extracts of strain. Our results demonstrated that halophytes are recognised as key source of potent bacterial strains capable of producing metabolites of industrial and medical significance.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Salinity stress influences plants throughout their entire life cycle. However, little is known about the response of plants to long-term salinity stress (LSS). In this study, Puccinellia tenuiflora, a perennial halophyte grass, was exposed to 300 mM NaCl for two years (completely randomized experiment design with three biological replicates). We measured the photosynthetic parameters and plant hormones and employed a widely targeted metabolomics approach to quantify metabolites. Our results revealed that LSS induced significant metabolic changes in P. tenuiflora, inhibiting the accumulation of 11 organic acids in the leaves and 24 organic acids in the roots and enhancing the accumulation of 15 flavonoids in the leaves and 11 phenolamides in the roots. The elevated accumulation of the flavonoids and phenolamides increased the ability of P. tenuiflora to scavenge reactive oxygen species. A comparative analysis with short-term salinity stress revealed that the specific responses to long-term salinity stress (LSS) included enhanced flavonoid accumulation and reduced amino acid accumulation, which contributed to the adaptation of P. tenuiflora to LSS. LSS upregulated the levels of abscisic acid in the leaves and ACC (a direct precursor of ethylene) in the roots, while it downregulated the levels of cytokinins and jasmonic acids in both the organs. These tolerance-associated changes in plant hormones would be expected to reprogram the energy allocation among growth, pathogen defense, and salinity stress response. We propose that abscisic acid, ethylene, cytokinins, and jasmonic acids may interact with each other to construct a salinity stress response network during the adaptation of P. tenuiflora to LSS, which mediates salinity stress response and significant metabolic changes. Our results provided novel insights into the plant hormone-regulated metabolic response of the plants under LSS, which can enhance our understanding of plant salinity tolerance.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Freshwater resources are in a shortage in arid regions worldwide, especially in extremely arid desert areas. To solve this problem, highly saline groundwater is used for drip irrigation of desert plants. Since more irrigation infiltrating into the deep soil cannot be absorbed and utilized by desert plants, it is crucial to determine optimal water-saving irrigation regimes. In this study, we examined the effects of irrigation regimes on the soil water dynamics of two typical woody halophyte species (Haloxylon and Calligonum), and quantified the irrigation intervals and periods based on a field test of precision irrigation control in the Taklimakan Desert Highway shelterbelt. Results showed that the change in soil moisture of two species in the shallow 0–60 cm layer could be divided into a rapid decline period (1–9 d), a slow decline period (9–19 d), and a relatively stable period (19–39 d) after irrigation. The decrease rate of soil moisture at the 0–60 cm depth was significantly higher than that at the 60–200 cm depth. The irrigation regime combining 35 mm irrigation with 10 days was beneficial to soil water storage and plant use with respect to Calligonum, while the irrigation regime combining 35 mm irrigation with 40 days was best for Haloxylon. Increasing the single irrigation amount and prolonging the irrigation period can further enable the more effective use of irrigation water. This study highlights that saline groundwater irrigation provides potential advantages for desert plants’ survival under reasonable irrigation regimes.</jats:p>",

In this sense, methanol and dichloromethane extracts were prepared from aerial organs containing flowers, leaves and stems, and were profiled for their chemical composition using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS). The extracts were evaluated for their in vitro antioxidant capacity using five complementary methods: enzyme inhibitory effects on enzymes related with neurodegeneration (acetyl (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE)), Type 2 diabetes (α-glucosidase and α-amylase), hyperpigmentation/food oxidation (tyrosinase), and cytotoxicity towards human hepatocarcinoma (HepG2) cells. Fifty-one molecules were identified in the extracts, including several derivatives of phenolic acids, lignans and flavonoids, monoterpenes, and hydroxylated derivatives of linoleic acid. The methanol extract was effective in DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging (EC50 = 0.25 and 0.65 mg/mL, respectively), copper chelation (EC50 = 0.78 mg/mL), and iron reduction (EC50 = 0.51 mg/mL) activities, whereas the dichloromethane extract had high iron chelating ability (EC50 = 0.76 mg/mL). Both extracts showed the capacity to inhibit α-glucosidase, especially the dichloromethane (EC50 = 0.52 mg/mL).

Here, we used 16S rRNA sequencing and FAPROTAX functional prediction to compare the rhizosphere bacterial communities of two key halophytes—Suaeda glauca and Phragmites communis—in a reclaimed coastal wetland. The results demonstrate that both plants significantly restructured microbial communities through convergent enrichment of stress-tolerant taxa (Firmicutes, Pseudomonas, Bacillus, and Planococcus) while suppressing sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (Sulfurovum and Thiobacillus). However, they exhibited distinct microbial specialization: S. glauca uniquely enriched organic-matter-degrading taxa (Promicromonospora and Zhihengliuella) and upregulated aromatic compound degradation (2.29%) and ureolysis (0.86%) according to FAPROTAX analysis, facilitating carbon mobilization in early successional stages. Notably, P. communis selectively recruited nitrogen-cycling Serratia, with increased nitrate respiration (3.51% in P. communis vs. 0.91% in S. glauca) function, reflecting its higher nitrogen demand. Environmental factors also diverged: S. glauca’s microbiome correlated with potassium and sodium, whereas P. communis responded to phosphorus and chloride. These findings uncover distinct microbial recruitment strategies by halophytes to combat saline stress—S. glauca–P. communis synergy through microbial carbon-nitrogen coupling—offering a template for consortia design in saline soil restoration.</jats:p>",

Several species have ethnomedicinal uses, and some are currently explored as sources of food and cosmetic ingredients. Halophytes are considered important alternative cash crops to be used in sustainable saline production systems, due to their ability to grow in saline conditions where conventional glycophyte crops cannot, such as salt-affected soils and saline irrigation water. In vitro plant tissue culture (PTC) techniques have greatly contributed to industry and agriculture in the last century by exploiting the economic potential of several commercial crop plants. The application of PTC to selected halophyte species can thus contribute for developing innovative production systems and obtaining halophyte-based bioactive products. This work aimed to put together and review for the first time the most relevant information on the application of PTC to halophytes. Several protocols were established for the micropropagation of different species. Various explant types have been used as starting materials (e.g., basal shoots and nodes, cotyledons, epicotyls, inflorescence, internodal segments, leaves, roots, rhizomes, stems, shoot tips, or zygotic embryos), involving different micropropagation techniques (e.g., node culture, direct or indirect shoot neoformation, caulogenesis, somatic embryogenesis, rooting, acclimatization, germplasm conservation and cryopreservation, and callogenesis and cell suspension cultures). In vitro systems were also used to study physiological, biochemical, and molecular processes in halophytes, such as functional and salt-tolerance studies. Thus, the application of PTC to halophytes may be used to improve their controlled multiplication and the selection of desired traits for the in vitro production of plants enriched in nutritional and functional components, as well as for the study of their resistance to salt stress.</jats:p>",

The objective of this study was to evaluate and correlate the nutritional composition, volatile profile, phytochemical content, and biological activities of seven halophyte species cultivated using a SCS (Disphyma crassifolium L., Crithmum maritimum L., Inula crithmoides L., Mesembryanthemum crystallinum L., Mesembryanthemum nodiflorum L., Salicornia ramosissima J.

Among these species, results showed that S. fruticosa had a higher content in protein (4.44 g/100 g FW), ash (5.70 g/100 g FW), salt (2.80 g/100 g FW), chloride (4.84 g/100 g FW), minerals (Na, K, Fe, Mg, Mn, Zn, Cu), total phenolics (0.33 mg GAE/g FW), and antioxidant activity (8.17 µmol TEAC/g FW). Regarding the phenolic classes, S. fruticosa and M. nodiflorum were predominant in the flavonoids, while M. crystallinum, C. maritimum, and S. ramosissima were in the phenolic acids. Moreover, S. fruticosa, S. ramosissima, M. nodiflorum, M. crystallinum, and I. crithmoides showed ACE-inhibitory activity, an important target control for hypertension.
