Desalinating brackish water has become a sustainable technology for drinking and agriculture to overcome global water scarcity. Thriving biodesalination technology has become more attractive and eco‐friendly than the present physicochemical desalination methods, which are expensive and energy‐intensive. Researchers are exploring the bioutilization of nature's potential for desalination using halophiles like haloarchaea, halobacteria, halophytic algae, and plants. Biomimetic desalination membranes have been developed, inspired by the desalination mechanism in animals. This comprehensive review explores recent advancements and potential applications of halophiles in biodesalination to exploit them effectively. It provides an overview of the opportunities and challenges associated with harnessing halophiles for the removal of salts from brackish and seawater sources. This review also focuses on insights into biomolecules produced by the halophilic microorganisms and halophytes in the desalination process. Understanding the mechanism of action of these biomolecules will edify the effective unexplored research areas in biomimicry and bioutilization to overcome the existing limitations in water treatment.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Salt cress (Thellungiella halophila) is a small winter annual crucifer with a short life cycle. It has a small genome (about 2 × Arabidopsis) with high sequence identity (average 92%) with Arabidopsis, and can be genetically transformed by the simple floral dip procedure. It is capable of copious seed production. Salt cress is an extremophile native to harsh environments and can reproduce after exposure to extreme salinity (500 mm NaCl) or cold to −15°C. It is a typical halophyte that accumulates NaCl at controlled rates and also dramatic levels of Pro (&amp;gt;150 mm) during exposure to high salinity. Stomata of salt cress are distributed on the leaf surface at higher density, but are less open than the stomata of Arabidopsis and respond to salt stress by closing more tightly. Leaves of salt cress are more succulent-like, have a second layer of palisade mesophyll cells, and are frequently shed during extreme salt stress. Roots of salt cress develop both an extra endodermis and cortex cell layer compared to Arabidopsis. Salt cress, although salt and cold tolerant, is not exceptionally tolerant of soil desiccation. We have isolated several ethyl methanesulfonate mutants of salt cress that have reduced salinity tolerance, which provide evidence that salt tolerance in this halophyte can be significantly affected by individual genetic loci. Analysis of salt cress expressed sequence tags provides evidence for the presence of paralogs, missing in the Arabidopsis genome, and for genes with abiotic stress-relevant functions. Hybridizations of salt cress RNA targets to an Arabidopsis whole-genome oligonucleotide array indicate that commonly stress-associated transcripts are expressed at a noticeably higher level in unstressed salt cress plants and are induced rapidly under stress. Efficient transformation of salt cress allows for simple gene exchange between Arabidopsis and salt cress. In addition, the generation of T-DNA-tagged mutant collections of salt cress, already in progress, will open the door to a new era of forward and reverse genetic studies of extremophile plant biology.</jats:p>",

These halophiles were molecularly identified and characterized with or without NaCl conditions. Characterization was based on tests such as indole acetic acid (IAA), exopolysaccharides (EPS), and siderophores (SID) production; solubilization of phosphate (P), potassium (K), zinc (Zn), and manganese (Mn); mineralization of phytate; enzymatic activity (acid and alkaline phosphatase, phytases, xylanases, and chitinases) and the mineralization/solubilization mechanisms involved (organic acids and sugars). Moreover, compatibility among bacteria was assessed. Eleven halophiles were characterized as highly tolerant to NaCl (2.5 M). The bacteria isolated were all different from each other. Two belonged to Bacillus velezensis and one to B. pumilus while the rest of bacteria were identified up to the genus level as belonging to Bacillus, Halobacillus, Halomonas, Pseudomonas, Nesterenkonia, and three strains of Oceanobacillus. The biochemical responses of nutrient solubilization and enzymatic activity were different between bacteria and were influenced by the presence of NaCl. Organic acids were involved in P mineralization and nutrient solubilization. Tartaric acid was common in the solubilization of P, Zn, and K. Maleic and vanillic acid were only detected in Zn and K solubilization, respectively. Furthermore, sugars appeared to be involved in the solubilization of nutrients; fructose was detected in the solubilization tests. Therefore, these biochemical bacterial characteristics should be corroborated in vivo and tested as a consortium to mitigate saline stress in glycophytes under a global climate change scheme that threatens to exacerbate soil salinity.</jats:p>",

The contribution of this interaction has piqued the interest of experts, who plan to do more research using beneficial microorganism in order to accomplish this vision. Plants engage in a wide range of interrelationship with soil microorganism, spanning the entire spectrum of ecological potential which can be mutualistic, commensal, neutral, exploitative, or competitive. Mutualistic microorganism found in plant-associated microbial communities assist their host in a number of ways. Many studies have demonstrated that the soil microbiome may provide significant advantages to the host plant. However, various soil conditions (pH, temperature, oxygen, physics-chemistry and moisture), soil environments (drought, submergence, metal toxicity and salinity), plant types/genotype, and agricultural practices may result in distinct microbial composition and characteristics, as well as its mechanism to promote plant development and defence against all these stressors.

Plants face extreme environmental conditions that may affect their biological mechanisms, thereby influencing their growth and development. Microorganisms possess substantial metabolites that aid in helping plants mitigate abiotic stresses. Plants’ interaction with microbes constitutes a diversified ecosystem, as sometimes both the partners share a mutualistic relationship. Endophytes, plant-growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPRs), and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMFs) are examples of microorganisms that play an essential role in alleviating abiotic stresses and, hence, improving plant growth. The plant–microbe interaction leads to the modulation of complex mechanisms in the plant cellular system. Moreover, the residing microbial flora also inhibits the phytopathogens, therefore, it becomes part of plants’ innate defense system. Keeping in view the growing environmental concerns, it is important to identify the role of the plant microbiome in the transportation of nutrients to maintain sustainable production. Furthermore, it is important to identify the factors enabling plants to recruit beneficial microbial species and how to deal with the potential pathogens. Therefore, this review aims to summarize the impacts of various abiotic stressors on agricultural productivity and the role of beneficial microorganisms in mitigating the negative effects of abiotic stresses. The literature review also shows that the beneficial microbes, including PGPRs, AMFs, and endophytes, adopt various mechanisms for ameliorating the negative effects of various stresses. It has been observed that biochar and microbes, either individually or in combination, can play a significant role in maintaining plant growth under stress conditions. Although conventional inoculation of beneficial microbes mitigates abiotic stresses and enhances productivity, the advancement in genetic engineering would help transfer specific genes from the microbes to plants to aid in abiotic stress mitigation.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Soil salinity, a growing issue worldwide, is a detrimental consequence of the ever-changing climate, which has highlighted and worsened the conditions associated with damaged soil quality, reduced agricultural production, and decreasing land areas, thus resulting in an unsteady national economy. In this review, halo-tolerant plant growth-promoting rhizo-microbiomes (PGPRs) are evaluated in the salinity-affected agriculture as they serve as excellent agents in controlling various biotic–abiotic stresses and help in the augmentation of crop productivity. Integrated efforts of these effective microbes lighten the load of agro-chemicals on the environment while managing nutrient availability. PGPR-assisted modern agriculture practices have emerged as a green strategy to benefit sustainable farming without compromising the crop yield under salinity as well as salinity-affected supplementary stresses including increased temperature, drought, salinity, and potential invasive plant pathogenicity. PGPRs as bio-inoculants impart induced systemic tolerance (IST) to plants by the production of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), antioxidants, osmolytes, extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), phytohormones, and ACC-deaminase and recuperation of nutritional status and ionic homeostasis. Regulation of PGPR-induced signaling pathways such as MAPK and CDPK assists in salinity stress alleviation. The “Next Gen Agriculture” consists of the application of designer crop microbiomes through gene editing tools, for instance, CRISPR, and engineering of the metabolic pathways of the microbes so as to gain maximum plant resistance. The utilization of omics technologies over the traditional approaches can fulfill the criteria required to increase crop yields in a sustainable manner for feeding the burgeoning population and augment plant adaptability under climate change conditions, ultimately leading to improved vitality. Furthermore, constraints such as the crop specificity issue of PGPR, lack of acceptance by farmers, and legal regulatory aspects have been acknowledged while also discussing the future trends for product commercialization with the view of the changing climate.</jats:p>",

In this work, seeds of the cash crop halophyte Salicornia ramosissima were inoculated with five different plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria consortia, isolated from the rhizosphere of five halophytes in southwestern Spain salt marshes. For the first time, we recorded seed germination response to three interactive abiotic stressors, CO2 (400 and 700 ppm), temperature (25 and 29 ℃) and salinity (171, 510 and 1030 mM NaCl), all of them related to climate change. Salinity played a decisive role, as no significant differences were registered between treatments at 171 mM NaCl and no germination took place at 1030 mM NaCl. At 510 mM NaCl, one rhizobacterial consortium improved seed parameters notably, increasing up to 114% germination percentage and 65% seedlings biomass.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The hydroponic farming significantly enhances the yield and enables multiple cropping per year. These advantages can be improved by using plant growth-promoting fungi (PGPF) either under normal or stress conditions. In this study, the fungal strain (A3) isolated from the rhizosphere of the halophyte plant <jats:italic>Aeluropus littoralis</jats:italic> was identified as <jats:italic>Penicillium olsonii</jats:italic> based on sequence homology of its ITS region. The A3 fungus was shown to be halotolerant (up to 1 M NaCl) and its optimal growth was at 27°C, but inhibited at 40°C. In liquid culture medium, the A3 produced indole acetic acid (IAA) especially in the presence of L-tryptophan. Tobacco plants grown under hydroponic farming system were used to evaluate the promoting activity of the direct effect of A3 mycelium (DE) and the indirect effect (IDE) of its cell-free culture filtrate (A3CFF). The results showed that for the two conditions (DE or IDE) the tobacco seedlings exhibited significant increase in their height, leaf area, dry weight, and total chlorophyll content. Interestingly, the A3CFF (added to the MS liquid medium or to nutrient solution (NS), prepared from commercial fertilizers) induced significantly the growth parameters, the proline concentration, the catalase (CAT) and the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities of tobacco plants. The A3CFF maintained its activity even after extended storage at 4°C for 1 year. Since the A3 is a halotolerant fungus, we tested its ability to alleviate salt stress effects. Indeed, when added at 1:50 dilution factor to NS in the presence of 250 mM NaCl, the A3CFF enhanced the plant salt tolerance by increasing the levels of total chlorophyll, proline, CAT, and SOD activities. In addition, the treated plants accumulated less Na<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> in their roots but more K<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> in their leaves. The A3CFF was also found to induce the expression of five salt stress related genes (NtSOS1, NtNHX1, NtHKT1, NtSOD, and NtCAT1). Finally, we proved that the A3CFF can reduce by half the chemical fertilizers inputs. Indeed, the tobacco plants grown in a hydroponic system using 0.5xNS supplemented with A3CFF (1:50) exhibited significantly higher growth than those grown in 0.5xNS or 1xNS. In an attempt to explain this mechanism, the expression profile of some growth related genes (nitrogen metabolism (NR1, NRT1), auxin (TRYP1, YUCCA6-like), and brassinosteroid (DET2, DWF4) biosynthesis) was performed. The results showed that all these genes were up-regulated following plant treatment with A3CFF. In summary the results revealed that the halotolerant fungus <jats:italic>P. olsonii</jats:italic> can stimulates tobacco plant growth, enhances its salt tolerance, and reduces by half the required chemical fertilizer inputs in a hydroponic farming system.</jats:p>",

Along with these, others are also frequent although their presence is not restricted to gypsum; they show a clear preference for them (gypsocline). While this phenomenon (gypsophily) has been studied regionally, and various hypotheses put forward to explain it, there has been little global synthesis. We present a preliminary check-list on the gypsophile and gypsocline flora of the Palaearctic and Australian areas as a part of a project to develop a global checklist of the World’s gypsophytes, which can broaden our ecological and biogeographical understanding of these unique environments. The database contains 935 taxa spanning 54 countries. The Irano-Turanian region —and to a lesser extent the Mediterranean region— emerged as the richest territories in terms of gypsophile species; this richness was much reduced in the Saharo-Arabian and, especially in the Eurosiberian regions. The factors that can modulate the richness of gypsophytes in a region are discussed and have been distributed into four groups: a) geological and edaphic factors; b) factors linked to the insular nature of outcrops; c) climatic variables and their interaction with the soil; d) biogeographical factors. The importance of those factors linked to insularity and, especially, to water availability is emphasized. Because the soil structure of many gypsum outcrops reduces water ability to plants, such outcrops can be regarded as “dry-islands” surrounded by less xeric substrates. The fact that gypsophytes can be grouped within a few major flowering plant clades across continents, confirms their pre-adaptations to these harsh and unique environments. Our work provides a preliminary database for exploring ecological and biogeographic issues relating to gypsophily, and we hope it will stimulate global interest in these valuable ecosystems.</jats:p>",

Salt-tolerant plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) can alleviate the adverse impacts of salt stress by mediating molecular, biochemical, and physiological status. In the present study, the bacterium Bacillus mycoides PM35 showed resistance up to 3 M NaCl stress and exhibited plant growth-promoting features. Under salinity stress, the halo-tolerant bacterium B. mycoides PM35 showed significant plant growth-promoting traits, such as the production of indole acetic acid, siderophore, ACC deaminase, and exopolysaccharides. Inoculation of B. mycoides PM35 alleviated salt stress in plants and enhanced shoot and root length under salinity stress (0, 300, 600, and 900 mM). The B. mycoides PM35 alleviated salinity stress by enhancing the photosynthetic pigments, carotenoids, radical scavenging capacity, soluble sugars, and protein content in inoculated maize plants compared to non-inoculated plants. In addition, B. mycoides PM35 significantly boosted antioxidant activities, relative water content, flavonoid, phenolic content, and osmolytes while reducing electrolyte leakage, H2O2, and MDA in maize compared to control plants. Genes conferring abiotic stress tolerance (CzcD, sfp, and srfAA genes) were amplified in B. mycoides PM35. Moreover, all reactions are accompanied by the upregulation of stress-related genes (APX and SOD).

    "abstract": "<jats:p>\n            Human activities have globally increased and altered the ion concentration of freshwater ecosystems. The proliferation of potash mines in Germany (especially intense in the early 1900s) constitutes a good example of it. The effluents and runoff coming from potash mines led to extreme salt concentrations (e.g. 72 g l\n            <jats:sup>–1</jats:sup>\n            of total salt content, approx. 149 mS cm\n            <jats:sup>–1</jats:sup>\n            ) in surrounding rivers and streams, causing ecosystem degradation (e.g. massive algal blooms and fish kills). This promoted scientific research that was mostly published in German, thereby being neglected by the wide scientific community. Here, the findings of the German literature on freshwater salinization are discussed in the light of current knowledge. German studies revealed that at similar ion concentrations potassium (K\n            <jats:sup>+</jats:sup>\n            ) can be the most toxic ion to freshwater organisms, whereas calcium (Ca\n            <jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>\n            ) could have a toxicity ameliorating effect. Also, they showed that salinization could lead to biodiversity loss, major shifts in the composition of aquatic communities (e.g. dominance of salt-tolerant algae, proliferation of invasive species) and alter organic matter processing. The biological degradation caused by freshwater salinization related to potash mining has important management implications, e.g. it could prevent many European rivers and streams from reaching the good ecological status demanded by the Water Framework Directive. Within this context, German publications show several examples of salinity thresholds and biological indices that could be useful to monitor and regulate salinization (i.e. developing legally enforced salinity and ion-specific standards). They also provide potential management techniques (i.e. brine collection and disposal) and some estimates of the economic costs of freshwater salinization. Overall, the German literature on freshwater salinization provides internationally relevant information that has rarely been cited by the English literature. We suggest that the global editorial and scientific community should take action to make important findings published in non-English literature more widely available.\n          </jats:p>\n          <jats:p>This article is part of the theme issue ‘Salt in freshwaters: causes, ecological consequences and future prospects’.</jats:p>",

Traditional methods of managing stress factors, such as developing resistant varieties, chemical fertilizers, and pesticides, have shown limited success in the presence of combined biotic and abiotic stress factors. Halotolerant bacteria found in saline environments have potential as plant promoters under stressful conditions. These microorganisms produce bioactive molecules and plant growth regulators, making them a promising agent for enhancing soil fertility, improving plant resistance to adversities, and increasing crop production. This review highlights the capability of plant-growth-promoting halobacteria (PGPH) to stimulate plant growth in non-saline conditions, strengthen plant tolerance and resistance to biotic and abiotic stressors, and sustain soil fertility. The major attempted points are: (i) the various abiotic and biotic challenges that limit agriculture sustainability and food safety, (ii) the mechanisms employed by PGPH to promote plant tolerance and resistance to both biotic and abiotic stressors, (iii) the important role played by PGPH in the recovery and remediation of agricultural affected soils, and (iv) the concerns and limitations of using PGHB as an innovative approach to boost crop production and food security.</jats:p>",

The addition of adsorptive polymeric resins in fungal fermentations has been seen to promote the production of new secondary metabolites and is a tool used consistently to generate new compounds with potential biological activities. A total of 349 fungal strains isolated from 63 selected plant species from arid ecosystems located in the southeast of the Iberian Peninsula, were characterized morphologically as well as based on their ITS/28S ribosomal gene sequences. The fungal community isolated was distributed among 19 orders including Basidiomycetes and Ascomycetes, being <jats:italic>Pleosporales</jats:italic> the most abundant order. In total, 107 different genera were identified being <jats:italic>Neocamarosporium</jats:italic> the genus most frequently isolated from these plants, followed by <jats:italic>Preussia</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Alternaria</jats:italic>. Strains were grown in four different media in presence and absence of selected resins to promote chemical diversity generation of new secondary metabolites. Fermentation extracts were evaluated, looking for new antifungal activities against plant and human fungal pathogens, as well as, cytotoxic activities against the human liver cancer cell line HepG2. From the 349 isolates tested, 126 (36%) exhibited significant bioactivities including 58 strains with exclusive antifungal properties and 33 strains with exclusive activity against the HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cell line. After LCMS analysis, 68 known bioactive secondary metabolites could be identified as produced by 96 strains, and 12 likely unknown compounds were found in a subset of 14 fungal endophytes. The chemical profiles of the differential expression of induced activities were compared. As proof of concept, ten active secondary metabolites only produced in the presence of resins were purified and identified. The structures of three of these compounds were new and herein are elucidated.</jats:p>",

In this study, we aimed to investigate the potential of deep-sea Dermacoccus abyssi MT1.1T to mitigate salt stress in tomato seedlings and identified genes related to plant growth promotion and salt stress mitigation. D. abyssi MT1.1T exhibited plant growth promoting traits namely indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and siderophore production and phosphate solubilization under 0, 150, 300, and 450 mM NaCl in vitro. Inoculation of D. abyssi MT1.1T improved tomato seedlings growth in terms of shoot length and dry weight compared with non-inoculated seedlings under 150 mM NaCl. In addition, increased total soluble sugar and total chlorophyll content and decreased hydrogen peroxide content were observed in tomato inoculated with D. abyssi MT1.1T. These results suggested that this strain mitigated salt stress in tomatoes via osmoregulation by accumulation of soluble sugars and H2O2 scavenging activity. Genome analysis data supported plant growth promoting and salt stress mitigation potential of D. abyssi MT1.1T. Survival and colonization of D. abyssi MT1.1T were observed in roots of inoculated tomato seedlings. Biosafety testing on D. abyssi MT1.1T and in silico analysis of its whole genome sequence revealed no evidence of its pathogenicity.

Therefore, a systemic approach to climate adaptation will be needed which acknowledges the multidimensional nature of plant-microbe-environment interactions. In the last two scores of years, there has been an enhancement in the understanding of plant’s response to microbes at physiological, biochemical, and molecular levels due to the availability of techniques and tools. This review highlights some of the critical factors influencing plant-microbe interactions under stress. The association and response of microbe and plants as a result of several stresses such as temperature, salinity, metal toxicity, and greenhouse gases are also depicted. New tools to study the molecular complexity of these interactions, such as genomic and sequencing approaches, which provide researchers greater accuracy, reproducibility, and flexibility for exploring plant-microbe–environment interactions under a changing climate, are also discussed in the review, which will be helpful in the development of resistant crops/plants in present and future.</jats:p>",

Recent trends in the field of PGPB research led to the development of versatile multifaceted PGPB that can be used in different field conditions such as biocontrol of plant pathogens in metal contaminated soils. Unfortunately, all these research efforts lead to the development of PGPB that failed to perform in salty environments. Therefore, it is urgently needed to address this drawback of these PGPB toward their efficient performance in salinity context. In this paper we provide a review of state-of-the-art research in the field of PGPB and propose a road map for the development of next generation versatile and multifaceted PGPB that can perform in salinity. Beyond soil desalinization, our study paves the way towards the development of PGPB able to provide services in diverse salty environments such as heavy metal contaminated, or pathogen threatened. Smart development of salinity adapted next generation biofertilizers will inevitably allow for mitigation and alleviation of biotic and abiotic threats to plant productivity in salty environments.</jats:p>",

During systematic sampling the frequency of the species along roads was significantly higher in the Mediterranean (native area), than along Hungarian (non-native area) roads, however the average number of individuals at the sampling localities were very similar, and no significant difference could be detected. Using a germination experiment, we demonstrate that although the species is able to germinate even at high salt concentrations, salt is not required for germination. Indeed salt significantly decreases germination probability of the seeds.

Two species, a diploid Salicornia patula and a tetraploid S. emerici were recognized. They can be easily distinguished by floral characters, but not only by their habitus, which varies extremely according to environmental factors. Both species differ also in seed morphology. Salicornia patula has dimorphic seeds, with larger central seeds reaching high germination rates. Germination patterns helped to explain the habitat preferences. The species rarely co-occur, however. The rare S. patula occupies drier habitats, on coastal mudflats or sands that are irregularly inundated. It occurs within the assoc. Suaedo maritimae-Salicornietum patulae. Salicornia emerici occupies the lowest coastal mudflats, regularly inundated, where nutrient-rich conditions prevail, and forms an almost monotypical assoc. Salicornietum emerici. Due to the synonymy of S. veneta with S. emerici, we exclude the occurrence of S. veneta in Croatia as an independent taxon.</jats:p>",

Brassica species contains oilseed and vegetable crops with great economic importance. Advances in understanding the mechanisms of salt stress in Brassica plants have enabled the development of approaches to better induce plant defense mechanisms at the time of their occurrence through the use of beneficial microorganisms or molecules. Both endophytic and rhizospheric microbes contribute to the mitigation of abiotic stresses in Brassica plants by promoting the growth of their host under stress conditions. In this review we summarized so far reported microorganisms with beneficial effects on Brassica plants and their mode of action. Another approach in mitigating the harmful effect of soil salinity may involve the application of different molecules that are involved in the stress response of Brassica plants. We reviewed and summarized their potential mode of action, methods of application and pointed out further research directions.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Environmental limitations influence food production and distribution, adding up to global problems like world hunger. Conditions caused by climate change require global efforts to be improved, but others like soil degradation demand local management. For many years, saline soils were not a problem; indeed, natural salinity shaped different biomes around the world. However, overall saline soils present adverse conditions for plant growth, which then translate into limitations for agriculture. Shortage on the surface of productive land, either due to depletion of arable land or to soil degradation, represents a threat to the growing worldwide population. Hence, the need to use degraded land leads scientists to think of recovery alternatives. In the case of salt-affected soils (naturally occurring or human-made), which are traditionally washed or amended with calcium salts, bio-reclamation via microbiome presents itself as an innovative and environmentally friendly option. Due to their low pathogenicity, endurance to adverse environmental conditions, and production of a wide variety of secondary metabolic compounds, members of the genus Streptomyces are good candidates for bio-reclamation of salt-affected soils. Thus, plant growth promotion and soil bioremediation strategies combine to overcome biotic and abiotic stressors, providing green management options for agriculture in the near future.</jats:p>",

Here, we demonstrate that this resilience occurs even after rapid osmotic shocks caused by a threefold change in salinity (a reduction from 34 to 12% salts) leading to massive amounts of archaeal cell lysis. Specifically, our temporal metagenomic datasets identified two co-occurring ecotypes within the most dominant archaeal population of the brines Haloquadratum walsbyi that exhibited different salt concentration preferences. The dominant ecotype was generally more abundant and occurred in high-salt conditions (34%); the low abundance ecotype always co-occurred but was enriched at salinities around 20% or lower and carried unique gene content related to solute transport and gene regulation. Despite their apparent distinct ecological preferences, the ecotypes did not outcompete each other presumably due to weak functional differentiation between them. Further, the osmotic shock selected for a temporal increase in taxonomic and functional diversity at both the Hqr. walsbyi population and whole-community levels supporting the specialization-disturbance hypothesis, that is, the expectation that disturbance favors generalists. Altogether, our results provide new insights into how intraspecies diversity is maintained in light of substantial gene-content differences and major environmental perturbations.</jats:p>",

In the present study, two calcium sensor families, CBL and CIPK, were investigated in a halophyte plant, Aeluropus littoralis, with a comprehensive analysis. Here, six AlCBL genes, and twenty AlCIPK genes were studied. The analysis of the gene structure and conserved motifs, as well as physicochemical properties, showed that these genes are highly conserved during evolution. The expression levels of AlCBL genes and AlCIPK genes were evaluated under salt stress in leaf and root tissue. Based on the real-time RT-PCR results, the AlCIPK gene family had a higher variation in mRNA abundance than the AlCBL gene family. AlCIPK genes were found to have a higher abundance in leaves than in roots.

Using genomic data, we found evidence of fine-scale population structure and gene flow among the localities established across the high-elevation plateau as well as fingerprints of historical demographic expansion. We showed that an increase in the effective population size could coincide with the Last Glacial Period, which was followed by the species demographic decline during the Holocene. Geographic distance plays a vital role in shaping the spatial genetic structure of P. pamirica alongside with isolation-by-environment and habitat fragmentation. Our results highlight a complex history of divergence and gene flow in this species-poor alpine region during the Late Quaternary.

The unsupervised classification of images was performed using GRASS GIS algorithms through several modules: ‘i.cluster’ was used to generate image classes; ‘i.maxlik’ was used for classification using the maximal likelihood discriminant analysis, and auxiliary modules, such as ‘i.group’, ‘r.support’, ‘r.import’, etc., were used. This document includes technical descriptions of the scripts used for image processing with detailed comments on the functionalities of the GRASS GIS modules. The results include the identified variations in the ephemeral salt lakes within the Algerian part of the Sahara over a 9-year period (2014–2022), using a time series of Landsat OLI/TIRS multispectral images that were classified using GRASS GIS. The main strengths of the GRASS GIS framework are the high speed, accuracy, and effectiveness of the programming codes for image processing in environmental monitoring. The presented GitHub repository, which contains scripts used for the satellite image analysis, serves as a reference for the interpretation of remote sensing data for the environmental monitoring of arid and semi-arid areas of Africa.</jats:p>",

Three different eco-friendly extraction methods are tested: microwave-assisted extraction (MAE), pressurized fluid extraction (PFE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE). Various specific parameters are optimized for each of them. Global extraction yields are calculated for all extracts. Moreover, the extracts are analyzed by HPLC–DAD–ELSD, and the obtained profiles are compared to estimate qualitatively and semi-quantitatively their composition. The practicality of each technique is also discussed. The results show that the various parameters tested for PFE and MAE do not drastically affect the extraction of our interest compounds.

We aimed to reveal bacterial effects on the formation of apoplastic barriers and hormone concentration in relation to maintaining ion homeostasis and growth of salt-stressed plants. The rhizosphere of a durum wheat variety was inoculated with cytokinin-producing Bacillus subtilis and auxin-producing Pseudomonas mandelii strains. Plant growth, deposition of lignin and suberin and concentrations of sodium, potassium, phosphorus and hormones were studied in the plants exposed to salinity. Accumulation of sodium inhibited plant growth accompanied by a decline in potassium in roots and phosphorus in shoots of the salt-stressed plants. Inoculation with both bacterial strains resulted in faster appearance of Casparian bands in root endodermis and an increased growth of salt-stressed plants. B. subtilis prevented the decline in both potassium and phosphorus concentrations and increased concentration of cytokinins in salt-stressed plants. P. mandelii decreased the level of sodium accumulation and increased the concentration of auxin. Growth promotion was greater in plants inoculated with B. subtilis. Increased ion homeostasis may be related to the capacity of bacteria to accelerate the formation of Casparian bands preventing uncontrolled diffusion of solutes through the apoplast. We discuss the relative impacts of the decline in Na accumulation and maintenance of K and P content for growth improvement of salt-stressed plants and their possible relation to the changes in hormone concentration in plants.</jats:p>",

Crossing them opens the possibility for organisms to colonize new niches and diversify, but requires profound physiological adaptations and is supposed to happen rarely in evolutionary history. We tested the relative importance of each ecological barrier by building the phylogeny, based on mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase gene (COI) sequences, of a group of microorganisms common in freshwater and soils, the Arcellidae (Arcellinida; Amoebozoa). We explored the biodiversity of this family in the sediments of athalassohaline water bodies (i.e. of fluctuating salinity that have non-marine origins). We found three new aquatic species, which represent, to the best of our knowledge, the first reports of Arcellinida in these salt-impacted ecosystems, plus a fourth terrestrial one in bryophytes. Culturing experiments performed on Arcella euryhalina sp. nov. showed similar growth curves in pure freshwater and under 20 g/L salinity, and long-term survival at 50 g/L, displaying a halotolerant biology. Phylogenetic analyses showed that all three new athalassohaline species represent independent transition events through the salinity barrier by freshwater ancestor, in contrast to the terrestrial species, which are monophyletic and represent a unique ecological transition from freshwater to soil environments.</jats:p>",

PHBV is a biodegradable polymer showing physiochemical properties of biotechnological and biomedical interest and can be used as an alternative to plastics made from chemical synthesis (which are not environmentally friendly). The versatile metabolism of H. mediterranei makes the use of waste as a carbon source for cellular growth and PHA synthesis possible. In this work, cellular growth and the production and characterization of PHBV using two different types of confectionery waste were analyzed and compared with cellular growth and PHBV synthesis in a standard culture media with glucose of analytical grade as a carbon source. The PHBV granules produced were analyzed by TEM and the biopolymer was isolated and characterized by GC-MS, FTIR NMR, and DSC. The results reveal that H. mediterranei can use these two residues (R1 and R2) for pure PHBV production, achieving 0.256 and 0.983 g PHBV/L, respectively, which are among the highest yields so far described using for the first-time waste from the candy industry. Thus, a circular economy-based process has been designed to optimize the upscaling of PHBV production by using haloarchaea as cell factories and valorizing confectionery waste.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Almost one third of Earth’s land surface is arid, with deserts alone covering more than 46 million square kilometres. Nearly 2.1 billion people inhabit deserts or drylands and these regions are also home to a great diversity of plant and animal species including many that are unique to them. Aridity is a multifaceted environmental stress combining a lack of water with limited food availability and typically extremes of temperature, impacting animal species across the planet from polar cold valleys, to Andean deserts and the Sahara. These harsh environments are also home to diverse microbial communities, demonstrating the ability of bacteria, fungi and archaea to settle and live in some of the toughest locations known. We now understand that these microbial ecosystems i.e. microbiotas, the sum total of microbial life across and within an environment, interact across both the environment, and the macroscopic organisms residing in these arid environments. Although multiple studies have explored these microbial communities in different arid environments, few studies have examined the microbiota of animals which are themselves arid-adapted. Here we aim to review the interactions between arid environments and the microbial communities which inhabit them, covering hot and cold deserts, the challenges these environments pose and some issues arising from limitations in the field. We also consider the work carried out on arid-adapted animal microbiotas, to investigate if any shared patterns or trends exist, whether between organisms or between the animals and the wider arid environment microbial communities. We determine if there are any patterns across studies potentially demonstrating a general impact of aridity on animal-associated microbiomes or benefits from aridity-adapted microbiomes for animals. In the context of increasing desertification and climate change it is important to understand the connections between the three pillars of microbiome, host genome and environment.</jats:p>",

Calcium signaling, as a vital mechanism, enables plants to respond to external stimuli, including abiotic and biotic stresses, and coordinate the basic processes of the growth and development. In the present study, the calcium sensor families, including CBL and CIPK, were investigated in the halophyte plant, Aeluropus littoralis, with a comprehensive analysis. Here, six AlCBL genes, and twenty AlCIPK genes were presented. The analysis of the gene structure and conserved motifs, as well as physicochemical properties, showed that these genes are highly conserved during evolution. The expression levels of AlCBL genes and AlCIPK genes were evaluated under salt stress in leaf and root tissue. Based on the real-time RT-PCR results, AlCIPK gene family had a higher variation in mRNA abundance compared to the AlCBL gene family. The AlCIPKs were found to have a higher abundance in leaves than in roots. The results suggest that the interaction pattern of AlCBL genes with AlCIPK is tissue-specific, and different interactions can be expected in leaves and roots. Based on these patterns AlCIPK3.1 - AlCBL4.1 and AlCIPK1.2 - AlCBL4.4 can interact in root tissue, while the AlCBL10 has the potential to interact with the AlCIPK5, AlCIPK26 and AlCIPK12.3 in the leaf tissue. These findings provide valuable information on the structure and function of calcium sensor families in Aeluropus littoralis a halophyte plant, for future research on the biological function of CBLs and CIPKs on salt stress resistance.</jats:p>"

Consequently, we aimed to (1) estimate the carbon stocks of the vegetation, litter, and soil of three natural Habitats of Community Interest of a Mediterranean non-tidal salt marsh–a halophilous scrub, a salt meadow, and a glasswort sward–and (2) determine how differences in floristic composition and community structure among habitats over 1 year are related to the amount and distribution of carbon stored in plants and soils. Results show that the halophilous scrub and the salt meadow were constituted by mature plant communities with overall stable carbon stocks in the vegetation, litter, and soil (0–20 cm), which were approximately 4 and 2.5 times larger, respectively, than those found in the glasswort sward (1013 ± 40 g C m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup>).

The differences in community compositions were associated with differences in the total and reducing sugar contents and viscosity of the seeds, thus possibly connected to differences in the osmotic pressure tolerance of the endophytes.

Compared to S. emerici, both halophytes recorded the highest percentages of organic matter and crude protein and higher concentrations of Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+ and Fe2+. These three halophytes, harvested during the summer period, showed important digestibility percentages (&gt; 70 % MS), exceeding those of alfalfa, and low levels of ADF, ADL and anti-nutritive compounds (condensed tannins, flavonoids and saponins). These findings suggest that the valorization of these native halophytes as fodder is promising, in particular S. alpini and S. fruticosa.

To investigate the underlying molecular mechanism involved in the salinity response in rice, we initially screened 238 rice cultivars after salt treatment at the seedling stage and identified two highly salt-tolerant cultivars determined by the relative damage rate parameter. The majority of cultivars (94.1%) were ranked as salt-sensitive and highly salt-sensitive. Transcriptome profiling was completed in highly salt-tolerant, moderately salt-tolerant, and salt-sensitive under water and salinity treatments at the seedling stage. Principal component analysis displayed a clear distinction among the three cultivars under control and salinity stress conditions. Several starch and sucrose metabolism-related genes were induced after salt treatment in all genotypes at the seedling stage. The results from the present study enable the identification of the ascorbate glutathione pathway, potentially participating in the process of plant response to salinity in the early growth stage. Our findings also highlight the significance of high-affinity K+ uptake transporters (HAKs) and high-affinity K+ transporters (HKTs) during salt stress responses in rice seedlings.

Biodiversitas 23: 3338-3343. Nitrogen is a very important nutrient in plant growth because it is one of the constituents of plant cells. The availability of nitrogen nutrients in the soil is very low, and this is because nitrogen is easily leached and easy to evaporate. Application of N-fixing microbes is one way to increase the availability of nitrogen in the soil. This study aims to utilize nitrogen-fixing microbes to increase nutrient uptake, production, and efficiency of urea fertilization. The study used a factorial randomized block design (RBD) consisting of Factor I, namely biofertilizer consisting of 4 treatments, namely without the application of bacteria (N0), Dyella japonica 5g (N1), Enterobacter cloacae 5g (N2) and D. japonica 2.5g + E. cloacae 2.5g (N3). Factor II is urea fertilizer with 5 levels U0 = No urea fertilizer, U1 = 1.25 g, U2 = 2.50 g, U3 = 3.75g and U4 = 5g. Parameters observed were plant height observed in weeks I-VIII, plant nitrogen (N) uptake (mg/plant), phosphorus (P) uptake (mg/plant), potassium (K) uptake (mg/plant), and plant production (g). Sampling of plants for analysis of nutrient uptake was carried out at the end of the vegetative period, namely the 8th week, while for plant production parameters, plant samples were taken at the 12th week. The results showed that the applications of nitrogen-fixing bacteria could increase N uptake up to 89.35%, P uptake up to 79.57%, K uptake up to 48.81%, and crop production increase up to 49.76%. The applications of nitrogen-fixing microbes can streamline the use of urea fertilizer by up to 50%. In general, the best treatment is the applications of D. japonica and E. cloacae plus 2.5g urea (N3U2).</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Dittrichia graveolens (L.) W. Greuter, an invasive plant species of Mediterranean origin, is recorded for the first time in Romania. We found the species in October 2020 in two separate locations along the main highway that connects Brașov and Sibiu cities, in Southern Transylvania, central Romania. We present here the first data concerning the species occurrence in the investigated area, its observed habitat, local distribution and accompanying species. We presume that the main vector for the introduction and dispersal of this species in Romania is the high traffic density along the major roads. Dittrichia graveolens has proven its invasive potential in other regions of Europe and North America of similar temperature and precipitation regimes under an overall temperate climate. Consequently, taking into account its fast dispersal, especially in the more favourable habitats for its establishment that exist along the major roads from the lower altitudes and the riparian communities from the western, southern and eastern parts of Romania, we conclude that close monitoring of the species occurrence should be undertaken in order to better assess its full invasive potential in our country and to reduce the risk of impact on natural plant communities.</jats:p>",

Determining how soil microbial communities respond to these stress factors and identifying individual phylotypes with potential to tolerate these conditions while promoting plant growth could help prevent negative impacts on crop productivity. This study used amplicon sequencing and several bioinformatic programs to characterize differences in the composition and potential functional capabilities of soil bacterial, fungal, and archaeal communities in five agricultural fields that varied in salinity and HM concentrations within the Indus basin region of Pakistan. The composition of bacteria with the potential to fix atmospheric nitrogen (N) and produce the enzyme 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (<jats:italic>ACC</jats:italic>) deaminase were also determined. Microbial communities were dominated by: <jats:italic>Euryarchaeota</jats:italic> (archaea)<jats:italic>, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Planctomycetota</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Firimicutes, Patescibacteria</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Acidobacteria</jats:italic> (bacteria), and <jats:italic>Ascomycota</jats:italic> (fungi), and all soils contained phylotypes capable of N-fixation and ACC-deaminase production. Salinity influenced bacterial, but not archaeal or fungal communities. Both salinity and HM altered the relative abundance of many phylotypes that could potentially promote or harm plant growth. These stress factors also appeared to influence the potential functional capabilities of the microbial communities, especially in their capacity to cycle phosphorous, produce siderophores, and act as symbiotrophs or pathotrophs. Results of this study confirm that farms in this region are at risk due to salinization and excessive levels of some toxic heavy metals, which could negatively impact crop and human health. Changes in soil microbial communities and their potential functional capabilities are also likely to affect several critical agroecosystem services related to nutrient cycling, pathogen suppression, and plant stress tolerance. Many potentially beneficial phylotypes were identified that appear to be salt and HM tolerant and could possibly be exploited to promote these services within this agroecosystem. Future efforts to isolate these phylotypes and determine whether they can indeed promote plant growth and/or carry out other important soil processes are recommended. At the same time, identifying ways to promote the abundance of these unique phylotypes either through modifying soil and crop management practices, or developing and applying them as inoculants, would be helpful for improving crop productivity in this region.</jats:p>",

This region’s population is projected to reach 2.4 billion by the year 2050, which will increase its food demand by 60%. However, recurrent droughts, temperature extremes, and increasing soil salinity are emerging as threats to present and future food security as they restrict agricultural productivity. The biggest challenge facing the SSA region lies in finding ways to adapt its agricultural practices to climate change. This article explores the potential role of extremophile microorganisms in enhancing crop resilience to abiotic stress. Research has so far shown that extremophiles alleviate drought stress in plants by increasing the expression of an array of novel genes, including genes responsible for induced drought, heat and salt stress tolerance, increased production of enzymatic antioxidants, as well as increased production of plant growth promoting phytohormones. Importantly, research shows that (i) extremophile-induced plant growth promotion and stress alleviation is triggered by the presence the stressor (ii) phylogenetically diverse microorganisms isolated from different desert plants can induce stress tolerance in heterologous crop hosts. These findings raise hopes of proofing crops against climate change-induced drought stress and hence ensure food security. However, research on the role of extremophiles in agriculture in the SSA region still lags behind. There is need to build capacity in extremophile agricultural biotechnology in this region, primarily in the form of bioprospecting for isolates exhibiting strong plant growth promoting capabilities.</jats:p>",

Microorganism-based biostimulants are recognized as sustainable alternatives to traditional agrochemicals to enhance and protect agricultural production. Marine actinobacteria are a well-known source of novel compounds for biotechnological uses. In addition, former studies have suggested that coral symbiont actinobacteria may support co-symbiotic photosynthetic growth and tolerance and increase the probability of corals surviving abiotic stress. We have previously shown that this activity may also hold in terrestrial plants, at least for the actinobacteria<jats:italic>Salinispora arenicola</jats:italic>during induced heterologous symbiosis with a wild Solanaceae plant<jats:italic>Nicotiana attenuata</jats:italic>under<jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic>conditions. Here, we further explore the heterologous symbiotic association, germination, growth promotion, and stress relieving activity of<jats:italic>S. arenicola</jats:italic>in tomato plants under agricultural conditions and dig into the possible associated mechanisms. Tomato plants were grown under normal and saline conditions, and germination, bacteria-root system interactions, plant growth, photosynthetic performance, and the expression of salt stress response genes were analyzed. We found an endophytic interaction between<jats:italic>S. arenicola</jats:italic>and tomato plants, which promotes germination and shoot and root growth under saline or non-saline conditions. Accordingly, photosynthetic and respective photoprotective performance was enhanced in line with the induced increase in photosynthetic pigments.

In addition, using seagrass as a feedstock for bioethanol production can provide a sustainable and renewable energy source while addressing environmental concerns. It is a resource-rich plant that offers several advantages for bioethanol production, including its high cellulose content, rapid growth rates, and abundance in coastal regions. To reduce sugar content and support efficient microbial fermentation, co-fermentation of macroalgae with seagrass (marine biomass) can provide complementary sugars and nutrients to improve process yields and economics. This review comprehensively covers the current status and future potential of fermenting macroalgal biomass and seagrass, as well as possible combinations for maximizing bioethanol production from non-edible energy crops. An overview is provided on the biochemical composition of macroalgae and seagrass, pretreatment methods, hydrolysis, and fermentation processes. Key technical challenges and strategies to achieve balanced co-substrate fermentation are discussed. The feasibility of consolidated bioprocessing to directly convert mixed feedstocks to ethanol is also evaluated.

As a result of metabolic functions based on 16S rDNA amplicon data, the genes related to potassium accumulation played an important role in osmoregulation in Tuz Lake, where the archaea population was dominant. Furthermore, bacteriorhodopsin, halorhodopsin, and sensory rhodopsin functions were determined. The abundance of bacteriorhodopsin and halorhodopsin were increased in summer and spring, respectively.</jats:p>",

The main objective is to identify soil properties associated with the presence of different Limonium species. Methods – We conducted a systematic phytocoenological and edaphic survey over 37 locations across the Balearic archipelago. Canonical Correspondence Analysis was applied to the physicochemical characteristics of soils in which 29 species of Limonium grow. Results – The distribution of Limonium species has a high correlation to specific edaphic factors. The species can be clustered into four major groups. The first group represents species with a high edaphic selectivity – soils characterized by having a high proportion of sand, SO42- and Ca2+. The second group is composed of species with high levels of SAR, OM and SO42- /Cl- ratio. The third group includes species present in soils with a loamy texture, low Ca2+ /Mg2+ ratio and high levels of CO32- and Mg2+. The fourth group includes plants which colonize soils that have a sandy texture, low salinity and high proportion of CO32-. Conclusions – A strong correlation between the distribution of Limonium species and soil characteristics exist. The study contributes to the establishment of foundations for habitat conservation, cultivation and recovery projects for endangered species of Limonium.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>&lt;p&gt;Foliar betalainic plants are commonly found in dry and exposed environments such as deserts and sandbanks. This marginal habitat has led many researchers to hypothesise that foliar betalains provide tolerance to abiotic stressors such as strong light, drought, salinity and low temperatures. Among these abiotic stressors, soil salinity is a major problem for agriculture affecting approximately 20% of the irrigated lands worldwide. Betacyanins may provide functional significance to plants under salt stress although this has not been unequivocally demonstrated. The purpose of this thesis is to add knowledge of the various roles of foliar betacyanins in plants under salt stress. For that, a series of experiments were performed on Disphyma australe, which is a betacyanic halophyte with two distinct colour morphs in vegetative shoots.  In chapter two, I aimed to find the effect of salinity stress on betacyanin pigmentation in D. australe and it was hypothesised that betacyanic morphs are physiologically more tolerant to salinity stress than acyanic morphs. Within a coastal population of red and green morphs of D. australe, betacyanin pigmentation in red morphs was a direct result of high salt and high light exposure. Betacyanic morphs were physiologically more tolerant to salt stress as they showed greater maximum CO₂ assimilation rates, water use efficiencies, photochemical quantum yields and photochemical quenching than acyanic morphs. Contrary to this, the green morphs, although possessing the ability to synthesise betalains in flower petals, did not produce betalains in vegetative shoots in response to salt stress. Moreover, green morphs, in terms of leaf photosynthesis, performed poorly under salinity stress.  In chapter three I further investigated the physiological benefit of betacyanin accumulation in D. australe. I postulated that betacyanin in the leaves of D. australe can protect the salt stressed chloroplasts from harmful excessive light by absorbing significant amount of radiation. To test this, a novel experimental approach was used; the key biosynthetic step for betacyanin synthesis was identified, which was deficient in vegetative shoots of the green morphs. By supplying the product of this enzymatic reaction, L-DOPA, betacyanin synthesis could be induced in the leaves of green morphs. This model system was used to compare the photoprotective responses of red vs. green leaves. The L-DOPA induced betacyanic leaves showed similar responses (such as smaller reductions and faster recoveries of PSII and less H₂O₂ production than in the green leaves) to naturally betacyanic leaves when exposed to high light and salinity. The differences in photoinhibition between red and green leaves were attributed to the light absorbing properties of betacyanins. L-DOPA treated and naturally red leaves showed lower photoinactivation than green leaves when exposed to white or green light, although not when exposed to monochromatic (red) light.  In chapter four, I used a similar experimental model to that in the third chapter and showed that other than photoprotection, betacyanins in leaves may be involved in salt tolerance by enhancing toxic ion (such as Na⁺) sequestration in betacyanic epidermal cells, storing Na⁺ away from sensitive mesophyll tissue. The Na⁺ localization between red and green leaves was compared after salinity treatment by using a sodium binding stain (SBFI-AM) and Cryo-SEM analysis. L-DOPA treated and natural red leaves sequestered Na⁺ ions to the epidermal cell layer. In contrast, green leaves retained Na⁺ in the mesophyll tissue, which suggested that red leaves were better equipped to tolerate salt-specific effects. Therefore, betacyanic plants were more tolerant to applied salinity stress and showed relatively higher growth rates than green morphs.  The findings of this thesis provide a significant contribution to our understanding of the role of betacyanins in plants under salinity stress. My data suggest that the multi-faceted properties of betacyanins (such as their photoprotective function, and their involvement in sequestration of toxic ions) clearly provide a benefit to plants under salinity stress.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

These changes demand a selection of an alternative method that is not only environment friendly but also sustainable. Aquaponics provides an ideal system for growing plants in soilless conditions. The Aquaponics system is a dual scheme of growing plants and fish at the same time. These systems utilize different approaches for growing plants and fishes simultaneously. This is through by circulating mechanism of an aquaponic system where fish waste in aquaculture provides nutrients to plants for the nourishment of hydroponic units. And plants purify water by utilizing nitrogen to maintain water for fish survival and growth. An aquaponic system is a sustainable methodology that does not affect the environment like conventional farming and is built on the recycling principle. A variety of vegetables like lettuce, cucumber, coriander, spinach, eggplant, basil are popular among domestic aquaponics farmers.

During salinity stress, plants encounter significant changes in their physio and biochemical activities, leading to decreased growth and yield. Bacillus species are used as biofertilizers and biopesticides for pearl millet and other crops to promote growth and yield. The use of Bacillus in saline soils has been beneficial to combat the negative effect of salinity on plant growth and yield. In this context, the present study emphasizes the use of two Bacillus species, i.e. Bacillus megaterium JR-12 and B. pumilus GN-5, which helped in alleviating the impact of salinity stress on the growth activities in salt-stressed pearl millet. Pearl millet seeds were treated with two strains, B. megaterium JR-12 and B.pumilus GN-5, individually and in combination under 50, 100 and 150 mM of sodium chloride stress. The treated plants showed higher plant height, biomass accumulation, and photosynthetic apparatus than the non-treated plants. Additionally, the treated plants showed increased osmoprotectant levels under salinity stress compared to control plants. The antioxidant enzyme content was improved post-inoculation, indicating the efficient stress-alleviating potential of both strains of Bacillus species. Moreover, inoculation of these microbes significantly increased plant growth attributes in plants treated with a combination of Bp-GN-5 + Bm-JR-12 and the reduction rates of plant growth were found to be alleviated to 9.12%, 20.30% and 33%, respectively.

Current seawater desalination methods can effectively provide freshwater and meet the growing demand for this resource. However, they are becoming increasingly controversial owing to their adverse environmental impacts, including high energy consumption and generation of desalination brine. For millions of years, various species of organisms such as plants, microalgae, and bacteria have adapted to environments with variable salinity and have developed mechanisms to eliminate excess intracellular NaCl. This has encouraged scientists to study the possibility of using biological processes for seawater desalination. Biodesalination is an emerging technology for the selective removal of Na + and Cl − from salt water by various halophile organisms, such as macrophytes, microalgae, and cyanobacteria, with very low energy consumption. Microbial desalination cells that allow simultaneous desalination of water in conjunction with wastewater treatment are also included in this category. The direct use of living organisms such as halophile plants, microalgae, and bacteria to desalinate water appears to be a promising field. However, the development and practical applicability of these technologies depend on the living organisms selected for desalinating seawater.</jats:p>",

High levels of radioactive exposure from external irradiation and a high radionuclide content lead to a decrease in the alpha diversity of soil bacterial communities, both in laboratory settings and environmental conditions. The effects of low or moderate exposure are not consistently pronounced or unidirectional. Functional differences among taxonomic groups that dominate in contaminated soil indicate a variety of adaptation strategies. Bacteria identified as multiple-stress tolerant; exhibiting tolerance to metals and antibiotics; producing antioxidant enzymes, low-molecular antioxidants, and radioprotectors; participating in redox reactions; and possessing thermophilic characteristics play a significant role. Changes in the taxonomic and functional structure, resulting from increased soil radionuclide content, are influenced by the combined effects of ionizing radiation, the chemical toxicity of radionuclides and co-contaminants, as well as the physical and chemical properties of the soil and the initial bacterial community composition. Currently, the quantification of the differential contributions of these factors based on the existing published studies presents a challenge.</jats:p>",

Analyzing the microbial structure of soil is important for efficient use of the soil, whether it be for agricultural purposes or other uses. Sabkhat Al-Madinah in Saudi Arabia has soil with high salinity and plants that thrive in that environment. The microbial makeup of the soil in this area has not been extensively researched. This study aimed to analyze the microbial structure of two locations in Sabkhat Al-Madinah's soil and examine the correlation with soil properties. The 16S rRNA gene's V3-V4 region was targeted for metagenomic analysis using Illumina MiSeq. The soil chemical properties including EC, pH as well the concentration of some soil elements were determined. The microbial composition of both sites were investigated at different taxonomic levels using MG-RAST and QIIME2 pipelines. There was a significant difference in salt concentration between the two sites that were derived from the same sabkha. The second sample had higher sodium content, leading to increased E.C measures. Moreover, The two samples had different microbial compositions. The first sample was dominated by Bacteroidetes (18.37%), Firmicutes (13.57%) and Proteobacteria (13.57%), while the second one contained Proteobacteria (25.01%), Actinobacteria (12.03%) and Firmicutes (11.36%).

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Salinity is one of the major factors responsible for the deterioration of soils, making them unsuitable for agriculture. The application of halotolerant and halophilic plant growth promoting bacteria (PGPR: Plant Growth Promoting Rhizobacteria) with biological control activities as an inoculant of cultivated plants offers a biological alternative to the use of agrochemicals, particularly when subjected to salt stress. In this perspective, 70 bacterial strains were isolated from saline soils (sebkha) in arid and semi-arid areas of eastern Algeria. Three isolates were selected based on their ability to produce bioactive molecules allowing them to promote plant growth, such as hydrolytic enzymes, indole acetic acid, HCN, NH3, etc. Two of these isolates belong to the genus Serratia and the third is a halophilic Halomonas bacteria. These bacteria were identified based on the 16S rDNA sequence. Antagonism tests against phytopathogenic fungi were carried out. The identification of the antifungal molecules produced by these bacteria was done by high performance liquid chromatography. These bacteria are capable of inhibiting mycelial development against phytopathogenic fungi with rates reaching 80.67% against Botrytis cinerea, 76.22% against Aspergillus niger and 66.67% against Fusarium culmorum for Serratia sp. The strain Halomonas sp. inhibited mycelial growth by production of volatile substances of Aspergillus niger at 71.29%, Aspergillus flavus at 75.49% and Penicillium glabrum at a rate of 72.22%. The identification by HPLC of the antifungal molecules produced by these three bacteria reveals that they are polyphenols, which makes these strains the first rhizobacteria capable of producing phenolic compounds. Finally, pot tests to determine the effectiveness of these strains in promoting wheat growth under salinity stress (125 mM, 150 mM and 200 mM) were carried out. The results revealed that a consortium of two isolates (Serratia sp. and Halomonas sp.) performed best at 125 mM. But, at higher concentrations it was the halophilic bacteria Halomonas sp which gave the best result. In all cases, there was a significant improvement in the growth of wheat seedlings inoculated with the bacteria, compared to non-inoculated controls.</jats:p>"

Though data on bacteria and algae observed in this lake are available in the literature, data on fungi adapted to the conditions of the lake are lacking. The diversity of haloalkalitolerant fungi was low and represented by ascomycetes of the genera Acremonium, Alternaria, Aspergillus, Chordomyces, Emericellopsis, Fusarium, Gibellulopsis, Myriodontium, Penicillium, and Pseudeurotium. Most of the fungi were characterized by moderate alkaline resistance, and they tolerated NaCl concentrations up to 10% w/v. The analysis of the antimicrobial activity of fungi showed that 87.5% of all strains were active against Bacillus subtilis, and 39.6% were also determined to be effective against Escherichia coli. The majority of the strains were also active against Aspergillus niger and Candida albicans, about 66.7% and 62.5%, respectively.

In the arid areas, aggravation of soil salinity has become the primary problem that threatens the high yield in tomato production. As a second messenger substance, cyclic guanosine monophosphate (c-GMP) plays an indispensable role in plant response to salt stress through regulating cell processes to promote plant growth and development. However, this mechanism has not been fully explored in tomato seedlings. In this experiment, the tomato seeds were cultured in distilled water (CK), 20 μM c-GMP (T1), 50 mM NaCl (T2), 20 μM c-GMP + 50 mM NaCl (T3). The results show that 20 μM c-GMP effectively alleviated the inhibition of 50 mM NaCl on tomato growth and development, inducing the expression of 1580 DEGs. 95 DEGs were up-regulated and 442 DEGs were down-regulated (CK vs T1), whereas in the T2 vs T3 comparison 271 DEGs were up-regulated and 772 DEGs were down-regulated. Based on KEGG analysis, the majority of DEGs were involved in metabolism; exogenous c-GMP induced significant enrichment of pathways associated with carbohydrates, phenylpropanoids and fatty acid metabolism.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Beneficial plant-growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) have been reasonably applied to rescue crucial issue for agriculture by salinity soil. Observed most of PGPB was found in endophyte, rhizosphere and soil. Indole acetic acid (IAA)-producing bacteria could naturally stimulate and facilitate plant growth. The knowledge of IAA production and content of bacteria resident in the marine environment has been typically insufficient and limited to date. In recent years, unwarrantable intrusions of sea water have been enlarged in the Mekong River Delta of Vietnam, threatening productive rice fields, local fruits, and cash crops. Therefore, finding PGPB in the coastal regions in the Mekong River Delta as a creative resource for sustainable agriculture is necessary and is a prompt challenge. In this study, IAA-producing bacteria from coastal regions of Ben Tre and Tra Vinh Provinces were isolated and adequately identified. Out of 202 bacterial isolates, 10 isolates showed the possible ability to produce IAA from L-tryptophan. These 10 isolates were objectively evaluated the capacity to produce IAA under 5% (w/v) NaCl in King B and marine broths. The results revealed that IAA production decreased in 5% NaCl, even though bacterial growth increased. These 10 IAA-producing bacteria were classified at the species level, Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus, M. pelagius, M. daepoensis, and Mameliella phaeodactyli by 16S rRNA gene analysis. The most IAA producer in King’s B broth, the isolate C7, was investigated in more detail. The isolate C7 produced the maximum IAA amount (192.2 ± 1.14 µg/ml) under the presence of 20 g/l yeast extract, 2 g/l of L-tryptophan and 1% NaCl. The isolate C7 was able to grow at 1–17% (w/v) NaCl (optimum, 4%), but not in the absence of NaCl, indicating it is a moderate halophilic bacteria. This study highlighted the considerable ability to produce IAA of marine bacteria, which could be thoughtfully considered to use naturally as biofertilizers to promote plant growth in saline intrusion lands. </jats:p>",

Az Arabidopsis thaliana 8 GPXL izoenzimet tartalmaz, amelyek különböző sejtorganellumokban lokalizáltak és eltérő redox-függő folyamatokban játszanak szerepet. Az AtGPXL5 egy kevéssé ismert plazmamembrán-kapcsolt izoenzim, bár szerepét feltételezték a sóstressz tolerancia kialakításában (Gao és mtsai. 2014). Kísérleteinkben konstitutívan túltermeltettük az AtGPXL5 cDNS-t és a növények fejlődésében és NaCl kezelésre adott válaszában vizsgáltuk az AtGPXL5 szerepét. Vizsgálatainkat AtGPXL5-túltermelő (OX-AtGPXL5) és Atgpxl5 mutáns növények felhasználásával végeztük. Eredményeink alapján az alábbi megállapításokat tettük: 1) A 12 napos Arabidopsis thaliana Atgpxl5 inszerciós mutánsok gyökerében magasabb szuperoxid gyök anion és össz ROS szint található kontroll körülmények között is, mint a vad típusú (Col-0) gyökerekben. A magasabb ROS szint az Atgpxl5 hajtások csökkent életképességét eredményezte. 7 napig tartó 100 mM-os NaCl kezelés tovább emelte a gyökerekben a O2•− mennyiségét, szintje meghaladta a vad típusban kialakultat. Ezek alapján az AtGPXL5 fontos szerepet tölthet be a reaktív oxigénformák homeosztázisában és a sejt életképességének fenntartásában. 2) A hat hetes Atgpxl5 mutáns és OX-AtGPXL5 növények antioxidáns mechanizmusait összehasonlítva jelentős különbségek mutatkoztak. Míg az Atgpxl5 mutánsban több antioxidatív enzim emelkedett aktivitást mutatott, az AtGPXL5-túltermelő növényekben a vad típushoz hasonló aktivitásokat mértünk. Míg az Atgpxl5 növények magasabb glutation peroxidáz (GPOX) aktivitással rendelkeztek, az OX-AtGPXL növényekben a GPOX és TPOX (tioredoxin peroxidáz) aktivitás is a vad típuséval azonos szinten működött. 3) Kontroll körülmények között a GSH tartalom szignifikánsan alacsonyabb volt az Atgpxl5 mutáns gyökerekben, míg az OX-AtGPXL5 hajtásban magasabb. Az alkalmazott sóstressz után az AtGPXL5-túltermelő növények rendelkeztek legmagasabb GSH és legalacsonyabb GSSG szinttel, a GSSG mennyisége az Atgpxl5 mutáns gyökerekben nőtt legnagyobb mértékben. Az OX-AtGPXL5 vonalak számított redukciós potenciál értéke negatívabb volt, mint a Col-0 vad típusé. Az eredmények megerősítették, hogy az AtGPXL5 fehérje szerepet játszik a redox állapot szabályozásában, amelyen keresztül a növekedést és fejlődést is befolyásolhatják. 4) Az AtGPXL5 protein szükséges az Arabidopsis thaliana csíranövények normál növekedéséhez és fejlődéséhez. Hiányában csökkent az elsődleges gyökerek hossza, biomasszája, a rozetta mérete, a hajtások klorofill- és antocián tartalma kontroll körülmények között is. 100 mM NaCl jelenlétében az Atgpxl5 mutáns és a vad típusú növények magjainak csírázása gátlódott, azonban az AtGPXL5 túltermelőké nem. Az OX-AtGPXL5 növények normal fiziológiás körülmények között a vad típushoz hasonló fenotípust mutattak, azonban 100 mM NaCl jelenlétében jobban növekedtek: nagyobb rozetta átmérővel rendelkeztek, a levelek nagyobb konvex területet foglaltak el, magasabb klorofill és antocián tartalommal rendelkeztek, mint a Col-0 és Atgpxl5 mutáns növények. Az Atgpxl5-nél megfigyelt csökkent hajtás- és gyökérnövekedés arra enged következtetni, hogy az AtGPXL5 fehérje szerepet játszik a növények normal növekedésében.</jats:p>"

In particular, Salinicola halophilus S28 showed optimal or suboptimal growth in a very wide range of NaCl concentrations, suggesting a great coping ability with salinity variations. These intriguing outcomes did not fit with the general Salinicola halophilus description as a moderately halophilic species. Therefore, this study profiles the actual physiological status of S28 cells subjected to different NaCl concentrations to provide evidence for the actual coping ability of strain S28 with broad salinity variations. Flow cytometry was selected as the evaluation method to study the physiological status of bacterial cells subjected to different salinity levels, monitoring the strain response at different growth phases over 72 h. Strain S28 showed maximal growth at 8% NaCl; however, it grew very well with no statistically significant differences at all salinity conditions (4–24% NaCl). Flow cytometric results provided clear evidence of its actual and strong ability to face increasing salinity, revealing a good physiological response up to 24% of NaCl. In addition, strain S28 showed very similar cell physiological status at all salinity levels, as also indicated by the flat growth profile revealed in the range of 4–24% NaCl. This is the first study regarding the physiological response during the growth of halophilic bacteria under different conditions of salinity via flow cytometry. This technique represents an effective tool for the investigation of the physiological status of each cell, even if it is somehow underrated and underused by microbiologists for this purpose.</jats:p>",
