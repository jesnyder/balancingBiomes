  "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: Suaeda maritima, a halophyte recognized for its adaptability to saline environments, holds promise as a valuable resource in nutrition and health. This study aimed to comprehensively assess the nutritional composition and phytochemical content of Suaeda maritima, exploring its potential as a dietary resource and source of bioactive compounds.\nObjectives: To analyze and compare the nutritional composition, phytochemical content, and antioxidant properties of fresh and dried Suaeda maritima samples. The investigation sought to determine the impact of the drying process on the plant's nutritive value and bioactive compounds.\nMethods: Fresh and dried Suaeda maritima samples were recruited for nutritional analysis which includes carbohydrates, proteins, fats, dietary fiber, minerals, and sodium content per 100 grams. Phytochemical content and antioxidant properties were assessed through total phenolics, total flavonoids, and antioxidant assays (DPPH and TBARS).\nResults: The results indicated that Suaeda maritima possesses significant nutritional value which contains carbohydrates, proteins, dietary fiber, essential minerals, and low-fat content in fresh and dried forms. Importantly, no statistically significant differences (p &gt; 0.05) were observed between fresh and dried samples regarding macronutrients and minerals, suggesting effective preservation of nutritional value during drying. However, notable distinctions were found in the phytochemical content and antioxidant properties. Fresh Suaeda maritima exhibited significantly higher levels of total phenolics and flavonoids than dried samples. Additionally, DPPH and TBARS assays identified that the antioxidant activities were more noticeable in fresh samples and allow to understand their health-promoting potential.\nConclusion: Suaeda maritima demonstrated substantial nutritional value with significant levels of carbohydrates, proteins, dietary fiber, essential minerals, and minimal fat content. The drying process effectively preserved its nutritional composition but it reduced phytochemical content and antioxidant activities. Careful consideration of processing techniques is essential to maximize the retention of health-promoting compounds, especially for applications in the nutraceutical and pharmaceutical industries.</jats:p>",
