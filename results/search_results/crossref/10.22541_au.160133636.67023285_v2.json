  "abstract": "<jats:p id=\"p1\">Halophytes adapting to live in salinized areas can activate some\ntolerance mechanism through signal compounds to cope with salinity.\nHowever, the role of co-activity of signal compounds in salt tolerance\nof halophytes is not yet fully understood. We have firstly detected that\n<jats:italic>Scorzonera hieraciifolia</jats:italic> with fleshy shoots is a succulent\nextreme-halophyte and researched the changes in signal compounds\ninvolved in the salt tolerance mechanism, including inorganic ions,\nosmoprotectants and substances related to antioxidant system. The levels\nof signal compounds such as calcium, magnesium, proline, soluble sugar,\nhydrogen peroxide, superoxide, ascorbate and glutathione concomitantly\nincreased when thickness of shoot tissues enhanced under excess\nsalinity. There were 3.3-fold, 5-fold, 8-fold and 10-fold enhancements\nin the levels of inorganic ions (Ca and\nMg), hydrogen peroxide, ascorbate and glutathione in\nthe shoots treated with excess salinity, respectively. Contents of\nsodium, potassium and chlorine, and antioxidant enzyme activities,\nsuperoxide dismutase, guaiacol peroxidase, ascorbate peroxidase,\ncatalase and glutathione reductase, also increased in the salinized\nshoots. Western blot analysis showed that the increases in antioxidant\nenzyme activities were consistent with increases in their protein\ncontents.</jats:p>\n    <jats:p id=\"p2\">The results suggest that extraordinary salt tolerance capacity in\n<jats:italic>Scorzonera hieraciifolia</jats:italic>, a succulent extreme-halophyte can be\nimproved by modulated accumulations of signal compounds, especially\ncalcium, magnesium, osmoprotectants, reactive oxygen species and\nantioxidant substances. Moreover, massive induction of antioxidant\nenzymes can make strong contributions to salt stress tolerance of\n<jats:italic>S. hieraciifolia</jats:italic>.</jats:p>",
