  "abstract": "<jats:p> NADP-specific malic enzyme (EC 1.1.1.40) has been purified about 160-fold from the moderate halophile Vibrio costicola. The enzyme has a molecular weight of about 120 000. The purified enzyme was unstable in dilute solutions but could be stabilised by NaCl or glycerol. NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>Cl or KCl caused maximal activation at 0.1 M, but higher concentrations were inhibitory. NaCl did not activate and was instead a mixed-type inhibitor towards NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>Cl or KCl. The salt concentration affected the kinetic parameters of the reaction. The apparent K<jats:sub>m</jats:sub> for L-malate reached a minimal value at about 0.1 M salt; the value for NADP, on the other hand, increased continuously with the salt concentration. The reaction also required a divalent cation activator, Mn<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> being better than Co<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> or Mg<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>. NADH was a mixed-type inhibitor towards both substrates, whereas oxaloacetate was strictly competitive towards L-malate and non-competitive towards NADP. The inhibition kinetics were sigmoidal for NADH and hyperbolic for oxaloacetate. The malic enzyme from V. costicola was similar to those of a marine Pseudomonas and Halobacterium cutirubrum in kinetic and regulatory properties but showed a response to salts intermediate between those of the latter enzymes. </jats:p>",
