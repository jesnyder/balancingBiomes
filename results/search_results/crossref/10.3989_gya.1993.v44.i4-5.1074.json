  "abstract": "<jats:p>Halophyte is an oil seed coded as SOS-7 (Salicomia Oil Seed, 7th year of selection). Tocopherol constituents of SOS-7 halophyte oil were determined directly in the oil by using high pressure liquid chromatography coupled to fluorescence detector. It was found that the oil contains 710 ppm total tocopherols. The tocopherol constituents, alpha, beta, gamma and delta, were found at the level of 38.2,1.0, 58.7 and 2.1% respectively.\r\nNine flavonoid glycosides were isolated and identified from the seeds and it was found that they belong to the flavonol class of flavonoids. These flavonol compounds were identified as: quercetin-3, 7-diglucoside, quercetin-3-glucoside-7-galactoside, quercetin-3-sophoroside, quercetin-3-glucoside, quercetin-3-galactoside, isorhamnetin-3, 7-di-glucoside, isorhamnetin-3-glucoside, kaempferol-3, 7-diglucoside and kaempferol-3-glucoside.</jats:p>",
