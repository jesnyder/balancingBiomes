  "abstract": "<jats:p id=\"p1\">The sulfur cycle is one of the geochemical element cycles in which\nmicroorganisms play a key driving role. The microbial function of soil S\ncycling in response to desert degradation, however, remains largely\nunknown. We used metagenomics to analyze the characteristics of\nmicrobial communities and their functional genes involved in the S\ncycles under natural water gradients with three typical halophytes\nshrubs in the Ebinur Lake Basin Desert, China. Our results showed that\nthe rhizosphere effect, water gradient, and halophyte type played a\nmajor role in shaping the S cycle. On the whole, in the rhizosphere type\nand low water environment, the functional genes involved in the S cycle\nhad high abundance, and the SOX system in <jats:italic>Alhagi sparsifolia</jats:italic> had\na high expression level. In the S cycle network structure, as the soil\nwater content decreased, the complexity in S gene networks increased,\nshowing the characteristics of clustering and high connectivity.\nIndicates the strengthening mode in microbial interactions with the\nwater content. Interestingly, the negative correlation of the network\nchanged with the water content, and there was more competition among\ncommunities under the low water gradient and more cooperation under the\nhigh water gradient. Through the correlation between environmental\nfactors and the network, nitrate (NO ) and soil available S (AS) constrained most S gene\necology networks. The key species involved in the S cycle were\nhalophilic microorganisms. These results can enhance the understanding\nof soil S biogeochemical processes and contribute to the mitigation of\ndesertification by improving soil conservation.</jats:p>",
