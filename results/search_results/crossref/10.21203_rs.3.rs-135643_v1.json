  "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n        <jats:p>The present study was aimed to characterize the chromate reducing ability of cells and cell-free extract (CFE) of <jats:italic>Halomonas smyrnensis</jats:italic> KS802 (GenBank Accession No. KU982965) and evaluate their effectiveness in tannery effluents. Viable cells of the strain reduced 200 µM Cr(VI) in basal medium for halophiles (MH) in 10 h and was inversely proportional to Cr(VI) concentrations. The rapid reduction by cells (10⁹ cells/mL) was achieved with 7.5% NaCl, at pH 7 and 37°C which increased with increasing cell density (10¹° cells/mL). While acetate, Cu³⁺, Fe³⁺, SO₄²⁻, and CO₃²⁻ were stimulating the reduction, the inhibitors retarded the process significantly. The NADH-dependent chromate reduction of the CFE was found to be constitutive with K<jats:sub>m</jats:sub> and V<jats:sub>max</jats:sub> values of 56.58 µM and 3.37 µM/min/mg protein respectively. The optimal reductase activity of the CFE was evident at 200 µM Cr(VI), 10% NaCl, pH 8.0 and at 45°C. A higher concentration of CFE and electron donors increased the enzyme activity but was impacted negatively by toxic metals and anions. Both the cells and CFE were capable of reducing Cr(VI) remarkably from tannery effluent. FTIR and XRD spectra of chromate reducing cells confirmed possible complexation of reduced Cr-species with functional groups on cell surface.</jats:p>",
