  "abstract": "<jats:p>Halophyte  plants,  which thrive  in  saline  environments, offer  sustainable  solutions  to  soil  salinization, waterscarcity,  and  climate  change.  This  article  examines  their  benefits,  cultivation  techniques,  economic significance,  and  challenges.  Halophytes  contribute  to  soil  reclamation,  biofuel  production,  and  food  security while also holding commercial potential in pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and renewable energy. However, limited awareness, high costs, and market barriers hinder large-scale adoption. Advancements in science, biotechnology, and policy support could integrate halophytes into modern agriculture, promoting economic growth, ecological restoration, and sustainable resource management.</jats:p>",
